        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes, complications, and survival of a long cementless titanium femoral stem in revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) at a minimum five year follow-up. Between 2000 and 2010, 114 patients (116 hips), with a mean age of 68\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0years, underwent revision THA using a KAR\u00ae stem (DePuy, Leeds, UK). The main reasons for revision were aseptic loosening (82%), periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) (11%), and periprosthetic fractures (6%). Mean follow-up was ten\u2009\u00b1\u2009three years (range, 5-16). Harris Hip Score (HHS), Oxford Hip Score (OHS), and Postel-Merle d'Aubign\u00e9 (PMA) score were recorded. Radiographic analysis assessed stem osseointegration and subsidence. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and cumulative incidence function (CIF). Post-operative HHS was 83\u2009\u00b1\u200915 (range, 35-99) and OHS was 37\u2009\u00b1\u20098 (range, 8-48). PMA score significantly increased from 12\u2009\u00b1\u20092 (range, 5-18) pre-operatively to 14.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092 (range, 9-18) post-operatively (p\u2009=\u20090.0004). The radiographic Engh score was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20098 (range, 7-22). Stem subsidence was observed in two cases (3%). At ten years, five stems had been revised, three for infections and two for periprosthetic fractures. Using the KM method, ten year survival free of stem revision for aseptic loosening was 100%, free of revision for any reason 95%, and free of any re-operation 81%. The present study reported satisfactory outcomes and survival of a long tapered unlocked cementless femoral stem in revision THA at a minimum follow-up of five years.",

        "title": "Can a Conical Implant Successfully Address Complex Anatomy in Primary THA? Radiographs and Hip Scores at Early Followup.",
        "abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with small or abnormal proximal femoral anatomy is challenging as a result of complex anatomic deformities in the hip. It is unclear which stem is the most appropriate for these patients. One possible implant design that may help meet this need is the modified Wagner Cone prosthesis, whose design consists of monoblock cone with splines; however, to our knowledge, no clinical results have been published using this implant. We evaluated the hip scores and radiographic results (including signs of osseointegration and subsidence) of complex primary THA using the modified Wagner Cone cementless femoral component in patients with small or abnormal proximal femoral anatomic proportions. Between 2006 and 2011, we performed 59 THAs on patients whose femoral geometry precluded the use of standard-sized implants. Of these, 49 (83%) received the modified Wagner Cone prosthesis. During this time, our indications for use of the Wagner Cone implant in such patients included: femoral neck retroversion, excessive anteversion of the femoral neck, or small proximal femora not suitable for standard implants. Of those, 40 patients with 49 THAs were available for radiographic and clinical followup at a minimum of 3 years, and no patients were lost to followup. The diagnosis included developmental dysplasia of hip (22 patients, 28 hips), secondary trauma or posttuberculosis osteoarthritis (nine patients, 10 hips), and hip disease secondary to other disorders (eight patients, nine hips) and osteonecrosis (one patients, two hips). Two versions of the stem with 135\u00b0 (28 hips) or 125\u00b0 (21 hips) neck angle versions were used to reestablish normal hip biomechanics. Version angle was chosen based on preoperative templating. Cementless cups with screws were used for the acetabulum. Mean followup was 4 years (range, 3-7 years). Study endpoints were the Harris hip score and radiographic evaluations by a surgeon not involved in the clinical care of the patients (QZ); radiographic analysis included evaluating for the presence or absence of signs of osseointegration (including Engh's criteria) and subsidence. The Harris hip score improved from a mean of 41 \u00b1 9 preoperatively to a mean of 85 \u00b1 10 at last followup (p < 0.01). The mean vertical subsidence was 1.5 \u00b1 1.1 mm. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated stability (no further subsidence) of all implants at last followup. Endosteal spot welds were found in 32 hips (65%). No progressive radiolucencies were observed. One patient (one hip) underwent revision surgery as a result of late infection; no other revisions were performed. The modified Wagner Cone femoral stem has provided improvements in hip scores and promising short-term radiographic results at short-term followup in complex cementless THA associated with abnormal or small femoral anatomical proportions in which standard implants are inappropriate. Longer followup will be needed to see if these results endure. Randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal stem design for these patients. Level IV, therapeutic study.",

        "abstract": "The ideal femoral component in revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) remains undetermined; however, tapered, fluted, titanium (TFT) stems are now widely used with favorable results in all types of revision scenarios. With both modular and monoblock TFT stem options, neither has been proven to be superior. Femoral stem subsidence has been linked to aseptic loosening, instability, and leg length discrepancy. This study aims to assess stem subsidence of modular and monoblock TFT stems at a single urban orthopedic specialty hospital within a tertiary academic medical center. Electronic medical records of rTHAs performed between January 2013 and March 2018 utilizing modular and monoblock TFT stems were examined. Data collected included baseline demographics, surgical indication, femoral Paprosky classification, and stem subsidence at most recent follow up (3 months to 3 years). Two-sample t-tests and chi-squared tests were used for statistical analysis. A total of 186 patients (106 modular, 80 monoblock) were included in the analysis. Modular stems underwent significantly greater subsidence than monoblock stems at latest radiographic follow-up (3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 vs 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 mm, P < .001). A significantly greater proportion of modular stems underwent >5 mm of subsidence at latest follow-up (29.2% vs 11.3%, P < .001). Monoblock TFT stems have displayed promising clinical results in prior studies, and now have been shown to decrease the incidence of postoperative subsidence. With the potential for stem subsidence to lead to aseptic loosening, limb length discrepancy, and instability, the orthopedic surgeon should weigh the risks and benefits of utilizing modular vs monoblock TFT stems in rTHA.",

Of these, clinical and radiographic follow-up examination by an independent observer was possible in 36 hips/29 patients after mean 14 years (range 10-18 years). Stem re-revision was documented by our own files and by the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Registry. \u2029Stem re-revision had been performed in two hips for aseptic loosening, one due to deep infection and in one patient due to stem fracture. The 18 years cumulative survival, free of re-revision for any reason was calculated as 94.4% (88.9-99.8)% and for aseptic loosening to 97.6% (94.3-100%). Intraoperative complications were frequent with incidence of shaft fractures (14/93) and perforations (9/93) showing a significant learning curve. Mean Harris Hip Score was 85 (range 53-99). Osseointegration was seen in 34/36 stems with two stems fibrous fixated. Stress shielding was significant associated with stem diameters \u226515 mm. Severe preoperative bone deficiency had no negative bearing on stem survival and no significant influence on osseointegration of the stem or on Harris Hip Score. \u2029 Femoral stem revision with an extensively porous-coated monoblock chrome-cobalt stem seems to be a reliable and reproducible technique resulting in excellent long-term survivorship and clinical outcome.

        "abstract": "Both modular and monoblock tapered fluted titanium (TFT) stems have gained popularity over fully porous-coated cylindrical (FPCC) femoral stem designs, but limited data exist comparing subsidence rates following revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). The purpose of this study is to determine differences in subsidence and clinical outcomes among 3 revision femoral stem designs. We reviewed a consecutive series of 335 patients who underwent femoral component revision to a cementless modular TFT (n\u00a0= 225), monoblock TFT (n\u00a0= 63), or FPCC (n\u00a0= 47) stem between 2012 and 2019. We evaluated radiographic subsidence rates, re-revision rates, and patient-reported outcomes between the 3 stems. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the independent effect of stem type on the risk of subsidence >5 mm. At an average follow-up of 39 months (range, 12 to 96 months), there were no differences in mean subsidence rates (3.5 vs 2.4 vs 2.1 mm, P\u00a0= .14), HOOS Jr scores (78 vs 74 vs 64 points, P\u00a0= .15), or aseptic re-revision rates (4% vs 3% vs 0%, P\u00a0= .29) between modular TFT, monoblock TFT, and FPCC stems. Although modular TFT stems were more often used in patients with extensive femoral bone loss (Paprosky III and IV), there were no differences in subsidence rates >5 mm among the 3 stems (P > .05) in multivariate analysis. Modular TFT, monoblock TFT, and FPCC femoral stem designs all perform well in revision THA with no difference in clinical outcomes or subsidence rates.

        "abstract": "Although good clinical outcomes have been reported for monolithic tapered, fluted, titanium stems (TFTS), early results showed high rates of subsidence. Advances in stem design may mitigate these concerns. This study reports on the use of a current monolithic TFTS for a variety of indications. A multi-institutional retrospective study of all consecutive total hip arthroplasty (THA) and revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) patients who received the monolithic TFTS was conducted. Surgery was performed by eight fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons at four institutions. A total of 157 hips in 153 patients at a mean follow-up of 11.6 months (SD7.8) were included. Mean patient age at the time of surgery was 67.4 years (SD 13.3) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.9 kg/m There were eight intraoperative complications (4.9%), six of which were intraoperative fractures; none occurred during stem insertion. Six hips (3.7%) underwent re-revision within one year; only one procedure involved removal of the prosthesis due to infection. Mean total subsidence at latest follow-up was 1.64 mm (SD 2.47). Overall, 17 of 144 stems (11.8%) on which measurements could be performed had >5 mm of subsidence, and 3/144 (2.1%) had >10 mm of subsidence within one year. A univariate regression analysis found that additional subsidence after three months was minimal. A multivariate regression analysis found that subsidence was not significantly associated with periprosthetic fracture as an indication for surgery, the presence of an extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO), Paprosky classification of femoral bone loss, stem length, or type of procedure performed (i.e. full revision vs conversion/primary). Advances in implant design, improved trials, a range of stem lengths and diameters, and high offset options mitigate concerns of early subsidence and dislocation with monolithic TFTS, making them a valuable option for femoral revision.

        "abstract": "To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared periprosthetic bone remodeling around monoblock versus modular tapered fluted titanium stems with different stem length and thickness. A retrospective comparative study was performed on 139 consecutive total hip arthroplasties (THAs) revised with a tapered fluted modular titanium stem and 114 consecutive THAs revised with a tapered fluted monoblock titanium stem. The latest follow-up radiographs were compared with immediate postoperative radiographs to assess bone restoration in residual osteolytic areas, femoral stress-shielding, spot-welds, and radiolucent lines. Diameter and medullary canal filling of the 2 stems were measured. More patients in the monoblock group demonstrated osseous restoration than in the modular group (p = 0.009), and the modular stem exerted more severe stress-shielding on the femur (p < 0.001). Stem tip spot-welds developed in 88.5% of modular stems compared with 47.4% of the monoblock stems (p < 0.001). Spot-welds developed in 38.8% of modular stems at the modular junction. Partial or circumferential radiolucent lines were observed at the proximal segment of 30.9% of modular stems, compared with 14.0% of monoblock stems (p = 0.002). Compared with the longer and thinner monoblock stems, modular stems had less proximal osseous restoration in residual osteolytic areas and more severe femoral stress-shielding, stem tip spot-welds, and radiolucent lines around the stems, which were stiffer and had a shorter distal section. The stem diameter and stiffness (which were influenced by stem length, curvature, and modularity) determined bone remodeling patterns. Therapeutic Level III.

Fifty-four patients (98%) achieved stable bony ingrowth on radiographic analysis. All 10 patients treated for periprosthetic fractures achieved bony union of their fractures. Two patients suffered intraoperative periprosthetic fractures and were treated with a cable-plating system. There were no mechanical failures and no femoral stem re-revisions. One patient was diagnosed with a deep infection and was treated with chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy due to significant medical comorbidities. Revision of the femoral component with a contemporary extensively porous-coated cobalt-chrome femoral stem has excellent functional outcomes, radiographic outcomes, and long-term survivorship with minimal complications.",

        "abstract": "The distally fixed stem used in revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) with extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO) is subject to periprosthetic fracture, stem subsidence, and stress shielding. The prospective multicentric study aimed to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes, and complications of using the Corail revision stem in rTHA with ETO. Sixty-four patients undergoing rTHA with ETO using the Corail revision stem between 2019 and 2020 were enrolled in the study. We performed a postoperative follow-up of the patient and obtained radiographs and Harris hip scores (HHSs). These results were used to analyze ETO union, Engh scores, bone remodeling, stem stability and hip function. The mean follow-up duration was 34\u00a0months (range 23-41). Sixty-two patients who underwent ETOs achieved complete healing at the final follow-up. Fifty-nine hips had bony ingrowth from the osteotomy fragment to the stem without radiolucent lines. The postoperative Engh score was 21.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.59 (range 15.5-27.0). Forty-three hips had regeneration in the proximal femur. Two patients had transient thigh pain postoperatively. The postoperative HHS improved from 40.7\u2009\u00b1\u200916.67 (range 0-67) preoperatively to 82.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.83 (range 73-93). Corail revision stems are a viable and reliable option in rTHA with ETO. This stem had excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes, resulting in a high rate of ETO union and stem survival. The revision stem enabled restoration of proximal bone stock in femurs with prerevision bone defects, which were prepared for the next revision operation.

A total of 66 hips of 49 patients with Crowe type IV developmental hip dislocation, with a mean follow-up of 90 (range 26-207) months, were reviewed retrospectively. Subtrochanteric step-cut shortening osteotomy and monoblock femoral stems were used. The cup was placed in the true acetabulum in all cases. 21 hips had previous femoral valgisation osteotomies. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of both hips were obtained preoperatively and at the last follow-up examination. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used for pre- and postoperative clinical evaluation. The mean HHS increased from 49 to 86 points. A total of 13 hips of 10 patients (the isolated acetabular component in 7 hips of 6 patients, the femoral component in 3 hips of 3 patients, and both components in 2 patients) were revised during the follow-up period. Dislocation occurred in 3 hips, deep periprosthetic infection in 2, superficial wound infection in 2, and femoral vein injury and sciatic nerve palsy in 1. Nonunion was observed in 3 osteotomy sites. 10-year survival probabilities of 91% for femoral components for all cases and 78% for acetabular components were found. THA with subtrochanteric femoral shortening osteotomy was proven to be an effective technique for avoiding neurological complications for Crowe IV DDH.

This study reports the short-term outcomes of a novel modern monoblock TFT stem used for revision and complex primary THA with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. We identified 126 patients who received a single monoblock TFT stem: 26 patients for complex THA (failed fracture fixation) and 100 patients for revision THA. The reasons for revision THA included 40 for previous periprosthetic joint infection, 42 for aseptic loosening, 9 for trunnionosis, and 9 for periprosthetic fractures. The Paprosky grading for femoral bone loss at the time of surgery and the measured subsidence of femoral stems at 3-month follow-up were determined. We evaluated the number and indications for reoperations. The mean time from surgery was 3.9 years (range, 2.0 to 6.9). A paired t-test analysis showed significant improvement from preoperative versus postoperative clinical outcome scores (P < .001) for Harris Hip Score (38.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.24 versus 83.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.38), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (45.6 \u00b1 19.0 versus 69.9 \u00b1 21.3), Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey Physical component (31.7 \u00b1 8.1 versus 37.8 \u00b1 11.3), and Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey Mental component (48.2 \u00b1 12.2 versus 51.6 \u00b1 12.5).

        "abstract": "Monoblock taper fluted stems have been reliably used to treat proximal femoral periprosthetic fractures (PFF) and femoral aseptic loosening (AL). Although proximal femoral remodeling has been observed around the Wagner Self-Locking (SL) stem, the exact characteristics of this process are yet to be established. Our aim was to compare the remodeling that takes place after femoral revisions for PFF and AL. Consecutive patients between January 2015 and December 2017 undergoing femoral revision using the Wagner SL stem for PFF or AL without an extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO) or bone grafting were selected from our database. Radiological follow-up was performed using plain antero-posterior hip radiographs taken postoperatively and at 3, 6, 12\u2009months and at 24\u2009months. The Global Radiological Score (GRxS) was utilized by four blinded observers. Intra and interobserver variability was calculated. Secondary outcome measures included the Oxford Hip Score and the Visual Analog Scale for pain. We identified 20 patients from our database, 10 PFF and 10 AL cases. The severity of AL was Paprosky 2 in 2 cases, Paprosky 3A in 2 cases and Paprosky 3B in 6. PFF were classified as Vancouver B2 in 7 cases and Vancouver B3 in 3 cases. Patients undergoing femoral revision for PFF regained 89% (GRxS: 17.7/20) of their bone stock by 6 months, whilst patients with AL, required almost 2\u2009years to achieve similar reconstitution of proximal femoral bony architecture 86% (GRxS: 17.1/20). Inter-observer reproducibility for numerical GRxS values showed a \"good\" correlation with 0.68, whilst the intra-observer agreement was \"very good\" with 0.89. Except immediate after the revision, we found a significant difference between the GRxS results of the two groups at each timepoint with pair-wise comparisons. Functional results were similar in the two groups. We were not able to show a correlation between GRxS and functional results. Proximal femoral bone stock reconstitutes much quicker around PFF, than in the cases of AL, where revision is performed without an ETO. The accuracy of GRxS measurements on plain radiographs showed good reproducibility, making it suitable for everyday use in a revision arthroplasty practice.",

No study has evaluated the use of monoblock fluted tapered titanium stems for this indication. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a monoblock stems on implant survivorship, postoperative outcomes, radiological outcomes, and osseointegration following treatment of THA UCS B2 and B3 periprosthetic fractures. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent revision THA (rTHA) for periprosthetic UCS B2 and B3 periprosthetic fracture who received a single design monoblock fluted tapered titanium stem at two large, tertiary care, academic hospitals. A total of 72 patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria (68 UCS B2, and four UCS B3 fractures). Primary outcomes of interest were radiological stem subsidence (> 5 mm), radiological osseointegration, and fracture union. Sub-analysis was also done for 46 patients with minimum one-year follow-up. For the total cohort, stem osseointegration, fracture union, and stem subsidence were 98.6%, 98.6%, and 6.9%, respectively, at latest follow-up (mean follow-up 27.0 months (SD 22.4)). For patients with minimum one-year of follow-up, stem osseointegration, fracture union, and stem subsidence were 97.8%, 97.8%, and 6.5%, respectively. Monoblock fluted stems can be an acceptable modality for the management of UCS B2 periprosthetic fractures in rTHAs due to high rates of stem osseointegration and survival, and the low rates of stem subsidence, and revision. Further research on the use of this stem for UCS B3 periprosthetic fractures is warranted to determine if the same conclusion can be made for this fracture pattern.",

The aim of this study was to compare the radiographic and clinical outcomes of Vancouver B2 PFFs treated with contemporary monoblock versus modular TFTs. A consecutive series of 113 patients (72 women, 64%, mean age 70 years [range, 26 to 96]) who had a B2 PFF were treated with either a monoblock (n\u00a0= 42) or modular (n\u00a0= 71) TFT stem between 2008 and 2021. The mean body mass index was 30 \u00b1 7. The mean follow-up was 2.9 years. A radiographic review was performed to assess leg length and offset restoration, endosteal cortical contact length, and stem subsidence. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to determine survivorship without revision, reoperation, or dislocation. There was no difference in the restoration of leg length (0.3 \u00b1 8.0 mm) or offset (2.8 \u00b1 8.2 mm) between the monoblock and modular cohorts (P > .05).

        "abstract": "Tapered, fluted, titanium (TFT) stems have shown good clinical outcomes in revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA), however concerns exist regarding early subsidence. This study compares subsidence between a modern monoblock 3-degree and a modular 2-degree TFT stem in rTHA. A retrospective, international multicentre comparative study was conducted including 64 rTHA in 63 patients. A monoblock TFT stem was used in 37 cases and a modular TFT stem was used in 27 cases. Patient demographics, Paprosky femoral bone loss classification, bicortical contact and stem subsidence were recorded at minimum four week follow up. There was no statistically significant difference in overall subsidence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.318) or the rate of subsidence >10\u00a0mm between stems. Mean subsidence was 2.13\u00a0mm in the monoblock group and 3.15\u00a0mm in the modular group. Two stems subsided >10\u00a0mm: one in each group. There was no difference in bicortical contact between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.98). No re-revisions were performed. We found no difference in subsidence between the two stems. Surgeons may consider the use of monoblock stems in rTHA as they have comparably low rates of subsidence and eliminate the small but potentially catastrophic risk of implant fracture at modular junctions associated with modular stems.",

The mean length of follow-up was 62 months (range\u00a012-152). There were 13 stem re-revisions: infection (4), periprosthetic fracture (4), aseptic stem loosening (3), stem fracture (1), and extended trochanteric osteotomy nonunion (1). Kaplan-Meier aseptic stem survivorship was 97.33% (confidence interval 94-100) at 6 years. There were 29 intraoperative fractures. There were 6 cases of subsidence greater than 10 mm; however, none required revision. Ninety-six percent of cases showed no proximal stress shielding. Thigh pain was reported in 3% of cases. This study confirms that this stem provides good survivorship at 6 years, acceptable complication rates, adequate proximal bone loading, low incidences of thigh pain, and reliable clinical performance in revision hip arthroplasty.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare modular and monoblock stem in rTHA surgery, focusing on clinical and radiological outcomes and complication rates. A literature search was performed using the following search strategy: ((Modular stem) OR (monolithic stem)) AND (hip review) on PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OS) compared clinical and radiological outcomes, and complication rates for monoblock and modular revision femoral stem were included. The risk of bias was assessed through the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) score. The Review Manager (RevMan) software was used for the meta-analysis. The rate of complications was assessed using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The authors included 11 OS and one RCT with 3,671 participants (mean age: 68.4 years old). The mean follow-up was 46.9 months. There was no prevalence of subsidence for one type of stem. Mean subsidence was from 0.92 to 10 mm for modular stem and from 1 to 15 mm for monoblock stem. Postoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) showed better results with modular stems without statistical significance [mean difference (MD) =1.32; 95% CI: -1.62 to 4.27; P=0.38]. No statistically significant difference was found for dislocations (OR =2.48; 95% CI: 0.67 to 9.14; P=0.17), infections (OR =1.07; 95% CI: 0.51 to 2.23; P=0.86), intraoperative fractures (OR =1.62; 95% CI: 0.42 to 6.21; P=0.48), and postoperative fractures (OR =1.60; 95% CI: 0.55 to 4.64; P=0.39). Modular and monoblock stems show comparable and satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes for rTHA. Both stems are valid and effective options for managing femoral bone deficit in hip revision surgery. The main limitation of this study is the small number and low quality of enclosed studies that compared the two stems. Moreover, the modular stem is usually used for more complex cases with lower quality femoral bone stock.",

This study sought to determine the radiographic and clinical outcomes of a monoblock FTTS in patients who had major femoral bone loss. A multicenter retrospective observational study of all total hip arthroplasty patients who received a monoblock FTTS who had up to 5-year radiographic follow-up was conducted. Only patients with femoral Paprosky classifications of IIIa, IIIb, and IV were included. Eighty-one monoblock FTTS were examined. Median clinical follow-up was 29 months (range, 18 to 58). Stem subsidence and loosening were assessed on most recent radiographs. All-cause revisions and stem survivals were assessed. Median subsidence was 1.4 millimeters (mm) (range, 0 to 15.0). Sixteen (23.9%) and 3 (4.5%) stems had subsidence greater than 5 and 10 mm, respectively. All stems not acutely revised appeared stable, without evidence of loosening, at latest follow-up. Ten hips (12.3%) required reoperations. Of these, only 5 (6.2%) stems were removed; 4 due to periprosthetic joint infection and 1 for surgical exposure during acetabular revision. Kaplan-Meier analyses yielded an all-cause stem survivorship of 95.1% at 2-years and 87.1% at 4-years. Stem survivorships excluding septic causes was 98.8% at both 2 and 4 years.

In addition to the usual total hip replacement, shortening and reduction of the femur are often required. We herein report on our surgical technique using a monoblock cylindrical cementless stem and a direct lateral approach. This study included patients with a diagnosis of severe developmental dysplasia of the hip (Crowe types III and IV) who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty at our hospital from August 2019 to January 2022. Eleven hips of seven patients were treated. All patients underwent horizontal osteotomy using a monoblock cylindrical cementless stem and a direct lateral approach. Complications such as dislocation, infection, and implant dropout were evaluated. In addition, the clinical assessment included the hip range of motion at the last observation and hip function based on the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) hip score and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Hip Disease Evaluation Questionnaire (JHEQ). The average operation time was 224\u00a0min (range, 194-296\u00a0min), and the average bleeding amount was 396.1\u00a0g (range, 20-1010\u00a0g). The main complications were acetabular implant dislocation, postoperative dislocation, intraoperative arterial injury, intraoperative proximal femoral fracture, subsidence of femoral implant. and postoperative pulmonary infarction, which occurred in one patient each. Total hip arthroplasty for Crowe type III and IV hips is associated with various surgical technical difficulties because of its anatomical characteristics. While patients with severe osteoporosis are contraindicated, the use of a cylindrical monoblock cementless stem and the direct lateral approach makes it possible to simplify the procedure for shortening the femur and increase the indications for surgery.

However, the differences between the two designs in clinical outcomes and complications are not yet clear. Here, we intend to compare the efficacy and safety of modular versus monoblock TFT stems in rTHA. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to include studies comparing modular and monoblock implants in rTHA. Data on the survivorship of stems, postoperative hip function, and complications were extracted following inclusion criteria. Inverse variance and Mantel-Haenszel methods in Review Manager (version 5.3 from Cochrane Collaboration) were used to evaluate differences between the two groups. Ten studies with a total of 2188 hips (1430 modular and 758 monoblock stems) were finally included. The main reason for the revision was aseptic loosening. Paprosky type III was the most common type in both groups. Both stems showed similar re-revision rates (modular vs monoblock: 10.3% vs 9.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.80) and Harris Hip Scores (WMD\u2009=\u20090.43, P\u2009=\u20090.46) for hip function. The intraoperative fracture rate was 11.6% and 5.0% (P\u2009=\u20090.0004) for modular and monoblock stems, respectively. The rate of subsidence >\u200910\u00a0mm was significantly higher in the monoblock group (4.5% vs 1.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.003). The application of extended trochanteric osteotomy was more popular in monoblock stems (22.7% vs 17.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.003). The incidence of postoperative complications such as periprosthetic femoral fracture and dislocation was similar between both stems. No significant difference was found between modular and monoblock tapered stems as regards postoperative hip function, re-revision rates, and complications.

        "abstract": "Modular revision femoral components allow the surgeon to make more precise intraoperative adjustments in anteversion and sizing, which may afford lower dislocation rates and improved osseointegration, but may not offer distinct advantages when compared with less expensive monoblock revision stems. We compared modular and monoblock femoral components for revision of Paprosky Type I to IIIA femoral defects to determine (1) survivorship of the stems; and (2) complications denoted as intraoperative fracture, dislocation, or failure of osseointegration. Between 2004 and 2010, participating surgeons at three centers revised 416 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) with Paprosky Type I to IIIA femoral defects. Of those with minimum 2-year followup (343 THAs, mean followup 51 \u00b1 13 months), 150 (44%) were treated with modular stems and 193 (56%) were treated with monoblock, cylindrical, fully porous-coated stems. During this time, modular stems were generally chosen when there was remodeling of the proximal femur into retroversion and/or larger canal diameters (usually > 18 mm). A total of 27 patients died (6%) with stems intact before 2 years, 46 THAs (13%) were lost to followup before 2 years for reasons other than death, and there was no differential loss to followup between the study groups. The modular stems included 101 with a cylindrical distal geometry (67%) and 49 with a tapered geometry (33%). Mean age (64 versus 68 years), percentage of women (53% versus 47%), and body mass index (31 versus 30 kg/m(2)) were not different between the two cohorts, whereas there was trend toward a slightly greater case complexity in the modular group (55% versus 65% Type 3a femoral defects, p = 0.06). Kaplan-Meier survivorship was calculated for the endpoint of aseptic revision. Proportions of complications in each cohort (dislocation, intraoperative fracture, and failure of osseointegration) were compared. Femoral component rerevision for any reason (including infection) was greater (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.63-2.57; p = 0.03) in the monoblock group (27 of 193 [14%]) compared with the modular cohort (10 of 150 [7%]). Femoral component survival free from aseptic rerevision was greater in the modular group with 91% survival (95% CI, 89%-95%) at 9 years compared with 86% survival (95% CI, 83%-88%) for the monoblock group in the same timeframe. There was no difference in the proportion of mechanically relevant aseptic complications (30 of 193 [16%] in the monoblock group versus 34 of 150 [23%] in the modular group, p = 0.10; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.86-2.53). There were more intraoperative fractures in the modular group (17 of 150 [11%] versus nine of 193 [5%]; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.68-2.73; p = 0.02). There were no differences in the proportions of dislocation (13 of 193 [7%] monoblock versus 14 of 150 [9%] modular; OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.67-1.16; p = 0.48) or failure of osseointegration (eight of 193 [4%] monoblock versus three of 150 [2%] modular; OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.88-2.84; p = 0.19) between the two groups with the number of hips available for study. Although rerevisions were less common in patients treated with modular stems, aseptic complications such as intraoperative fractures were more common in that group, and the sample was too small to evaluate corrosion-related or fatigue concerns associated with modularity. We cannot therefore conclude from this that one design is superior to the other. Larger studies and pooled analyses will need to be performed to answer this question, but we believe modularity should be avoided in more straightforward cases if possible.

We assessed leg-length discrepancy (LLD) before and after revision and compared the occurrence of leg-length inequality between the 2 cohorts. We found that the incidence of LLD was high in revision hip arthroplasty and that leg shortening was more common than lengthening. Both acetabular and femoral sides contributed to postoperative LLD. Appropriate placement of the femoral components was most critical in adjusting LLD.

        "title": "[Cement-within-cement femoral stem reimplantation technique].",
        "abstract": "The reimplantation of a cemented femoral component at revision is always a challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon, particularly when the cement mantle is intact. The aim of this study was to provide evidence that the recementing of a femoral stem into the original cement mantle can be included in routine surgical procedures. A group of 104 patients with femoral stem revision, followed-up for an average of 50.2 months, were retrospectively reviewed. The outcome evaluation was focused, in the first place, on survivorship of the femoral component, acetabular migration, and dislocation and infection after revision arthroplasty. Hip function evaluation was based on the Harris hip scores before surgery and at the latest follow-up. On radiographs Gruen zones were assessed pre-operatively and at the latest follow-up. The results were statistically evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Statistica 8.0). Of the 104 patients, only three (2.9 %) had stem re-revision due to its loosening. Further 16 patients underwent revision for other post-operative complications. The success rate of reimplantation in our group including all post-operative complications was 81.7 %. The average Harris scores were 56 before surgery and 87 at the latest follow-up. Radiolucent lines in Gruen zones were on average 0.45 mm in width before revision and 0.15 mm at the latest follow-up. Fourteen patients had second revision within 20 months of the first and only five were revised after a long period. The cement-within-cement exchange of a femoral component is a relatively frequent orthopaedic procedure. Despite this frequency, however, there have not been enough literature reports based on large patient groups to give support to its routine use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate on a large patient group that recementing a femoral stem into the original intact cement mantle can be considered an established operative technique. Our results suggest that the list of indications for this technique, as described by Lieberman and Nelson, can be extended by the following: broken stem with an intact distal cement mantle, replacement of a monoblock femoral component due to severe head damage, loosening of the femoral component without impairment of the distal cement mantle, conversion of a cervico-capital to a total hip replacement and the need of removing all bone cement. No risk is associated with reimplantation of the original component if there is no need for a different implant to correct angle or length stability. A new implant is always used when any part of the femoral component has been damaged mechanically. If only the proximal stem requires recementing, the use of the original component is preferred because of absolute cement/stem cohesion. The number of our patients in which the technique failed was generally in agreement with the results of other authors. Utilisation of the original cement mantle of a femoral component is one of the options at revision arthroplasty. It requires rational considerations based on the type of surgery, state of the cement mantle, and type of material used for the femoral stem. The method is indicated preferably in the hips with an intact cement mantle treated for loosening of the acetabular component, recurrent dislocation or unequal leg-length in monoblock femoral components. In such situations the removal of well-fixed cement would also involve a considerable loss of bone tissue. The follow-up outcomes showed that the involvement of the cement-within-cement technique in routinely used surgical procedures is fully justified.",

        "abstract": "Response/Recommendation The literature delineates distinct differences between modular and monoblock femoral stems in revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA), each presenting unique advantages and limitations. Modular stems offer intraoperative flexibility, enabling precise restoration of leg length and offset. However, they are associated with complications such as junctional fatigue, corrosion, and implant breakage, and they incur much higher costs compared to monoblock stems. In contrast, monoblock stems provide enhanced mechanical stability and no risk of modular junction complications, though their implantation is technically more challenging. Both modular and monoblock femoral stem designs perform well in revision THA, exhibiting no significant differences in long-term (3-5 years) clinical outcomes or subsidence rates. The choice between modular and monoblock stems should be tailored to individual patient needs and specific clinical scenarios. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Moderate.

        "abstract": "Recurrent dislocation of Total Hip Replacement (THR) is often multifactorial and remains a significant surgical challenge with a significant risk of further instability. Dual Mobility Cups (DMC) have been used widely with good long term results in France with few studies in the British literature, especially assessing their use for recurrent instability. We set out to assess whether recurrent instability can be successfully treated solely with revision of acetabular component to a dual mobility cup. We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected electronic database for all consecutive dual mobility cups implanted to address recurrently instability in THR. Radiological and clinical data have been analysed. From September 2013 to September 2017 54 dual mobility cups have been implanted, mean age 78 (range 49-97). 47 were 1st time revision procedures, 7 were following previous revisions including 5 failed PLADs. Average time post primary was 10 years (range 8 months-23 years). Twenty cases are cement in cement revisions which has become our primary technique for revision of cemented cups. Mean follow up is 1.9 years (range 6 months-5 years), 37 cases have 2 year follow up available. 8 patients have died. There have been no episodes of further instability. One patient has had reoperation for infection (1st stage revision). This series demonstrates satisfactory early to mid-term results for the use of dual mobility cups to treat recurrent instability. The technique is particularly useful when femoral components are well fixed and can be used with monoblock implants such as the Charnley stem. Cement in cement revision is a convenient technique and potentially reduces complications and cost. Further analysis of longer term data is required but these results suggests this could be a valid solution to a complex problem.",

We retrospectively reviewed our cases using the modified Wagner Cone (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) implanted over a 13-year period (2006-2019) in patients with small or abnormal proximal femoral anatomy. We performed 144 primary THAs in 114 patients using this prosthesis. Mean follow-up was 4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u00a0years (range, 1-13\u00a0years). Common reasons for implantation were hip dysplasia (52%) and osteoarthritis in patients with small femoral proportions (22%). Analysis of outcomes included assessment of stem subsidence and stability. Survival was 98.6% in aseptic cases; revision-free survival was 97.9%. Femoral subsidence occurred in 84 cases (58%). No subsidence progressed after 3\u00a0months. Of those that subsided, the mean distance was 2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0mm.

        "abstract": "This series assessed the clinical and radiographic outcomes of total hip arthroplasty (THA) with femoral shortening osteotomy for the management of patients with Crowe type IV hip dysplasia. Only patients with Crowe type IV hip dysplasia who underwent primary THA combined with a subtrochanteric transverse osteotomy with an uncemented monoblock conical stem were included. The clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed before and immediately after surgery, and at last follow-up. The hip function was assessed with the Harris Hip Score (HHS). Seventy-four patients (102 hips) with a mean age of 53.9 (range, 20-83) were evaluated at an average follow-up of 11.3\u00a0years (range, 5-25). Stem revision occurred in two (1.9%) cases, with a survivorship of 95.9% (95%IC, 91.9-99.9%) at ten\u00a0years. The average HHS increased from 44 (range, 15-78) pre-operatively to 90.3 (range, 62-100) at last follow-up (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Osteotomy site non-union and early dislocation were observed in 3.9 and 3.8%, respectively. No cases of nerve palsy were reported. THA with a monoblock conical stem associated with subtrochanteric transverse osteotomy provides good long-term survival, clinical and radiographic results. It may be considered an effective management of patients with Crowe IV hip dysplasia.",

        "abstract": "The objective was to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures in patients older than 65 years treated at our institution from 2000 to 2014. We compared the most common methods of fixation: a modular tapered rectangular titanium stem versus a monoblock tapered stem. A retrospective review was performed with a minimum follow-up time of 2 years. Patient mobility in the period prior to the fracture and after fracture healing and functional results was assessed according to the Harris Hip Score. A total of 43 Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic fractures fulfilled the inclusion criteria (31 type B2 and 13 type B3). The mean age was 78 years old (66-88 years). The mean follow-up time was 5 years (range 2-12 years). A Wagner stem was used in 19 patients and a modular rectangular stem was implanted in 24 patients. Although fracture union was achieved in 93% of the cases, the mean Harris Hip Score was 73 (34-87) and 41.9% of the patients did not return to their previous ambulatory levels ( p = 0.0049). Dislocation was the most common complication (16.3%). We have found association ( p = 0.07) between subsidence with a mean of 4.14 mm and dislocation. No difference was observed between B2 and B3 fractures or between modular and monoblock stems. Although we reported good results of fracture healing, there were functional impairment and a high rate of complications, especially dislocation, in Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic fractures in elderly patients.",

        "abstract": "Revision of monoblock metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty (THA) is associated with high complication rates. Limited revision by conversion to a dual mobility (DM) without acetabular component extraction may mitigate these complications. However, the concern for polyethylene wear and osteolysis remains unsettled. This study investigates the results of DM conversion of monoblock MoM THA compared to formal acetabular revision. One hundred forty-three revisions of monoblock MoM THA were reviewed. Twenty-nine were revisions to a DM construct, and 114 were complete revisions of the acetabular component. Mean patient age was 61, 54% were women. Components used, acetabular cup position, radiographic outcomes, serum metal ion levels, and HOOS Jr clinical outcome scores were investigated. At 3.9 years of follow-up (range 2-5), there were 2 revisions (6.9%) in the DM cohort, 1 for instability and another for periprosthetic fracture. Among the formal acetabular revision group there was a 20% major complication rate (23/114) and 16% underwent revision surgery (18/114) for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component (6%), deep infection (6%), dislocation (4%), acetabular fracture (3%), or delayed wound healing (6%). In the DM cohort, there were no radiographic signs of aseptic loosening, component migration, or polyethylene wear. One DM patient had a small posterior metadiaphyseal femur lesion that will require close monitoring. There were no other radiographic signs of osteolysis. There were no clinically significant elevations of serum metal ion levels. HOOS Jr scores were favorable. Limited revision with conversion to DM is a viable treatment option for failed monoblock MoM THA with lower complication rates than formal revision. Limited revision to DM appears to be a safe option for revision of monoblock MoM THA with a cup in good position and an internal geometry free of sharp edges or articular surface damage. Longer follow-up is needed to demonstrate any potential wear implications of these articulations.",

        "abstract": "Revision hip arthroplasty for metal-on-metal arthroplasty (MOMA) in the presence of an adverse local tissue reaction (ALTR) has been associated with compromised outcomes. We hypothesized that revision of MOMA for painful micromotion of the cup, in the absence of ALTR, would have a more favorable outcome. We reviewed our database for Durom acetabular shell revision with minimum 24 months (24\u00a0months to 8 years) follow-up. Patients with a diagnosis of painful micromotion in the absence of pseudotumor was identified. At mid-term follow-up, 71 patients had undergone revision of a Durom MOMA. Twenty-seven of these (38%) were for painful micromotion (9 total hip arthroplasty, 18 hip resurfacing) of the cup alone. Following revision surgery, all patients reported resolution of the preoperative pain, as well as satisfactory outcome measures (mean scores: The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] 84.6, oxford hip score 84.7, Short Form Health Survey (SF-16) 51, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 7.3). Radiologically, all cases demonstrated osseointegration of the revision shells; 1 case had zone-3 radiolucency that was nonprogressive. One patient had a dislocation treated by closed reduction at 10 weeks. Revision MOMA for painful micromotion of the shell in the absence of ALTR is not similar to revision for ALTR and is associated with predictable improvement in pain and quality of life.",

        "abstract": "For cup revision after total hip arthroplasty, sufficiently good periacetabular bone stock is a prerequisite for fixation of the revision implant. Cementless cups can lead to a relevant reduction of peri-implant bone mineral density (BMD) through stress-shielding. Fifty patients were included in this prospective randomized controlled trial. Group 1 (RM group) received an isoelastic monoblock cup (RM Pressfit vitamys; Mathys). Group 2 (IT group) received a modular titanium cup (Allofit-S IT Alloclassic with a polyethylene liner; Zimmer). Periacetabular BMD was determined and subdivided into 4 regions of interest by dual x-ray absorptiometry at 1 week (baseline) and at 4 years postoperatively. Our primary outcome was reduction in periacetabular BMD. Periacetabular BMD was reduced by an average of 15.1% in the RM group and 16.5% in the IT group at 4 years postoperatively. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups over the periacetabular structure as a whole. However, the decrease of BMD in the polar region was significantly different in the RM group (4.9% \u00b1 10.0%) compared with the IT group (15.9% \u00b1 14.9%, p = 0.005). Use of the isoelastic RM cup showed significantly less bone loss than the modular IT cup. Relevant loss of BMD at 4 years after surgery was identified in the periacetabular region in both groups. No differences between the 2 cup systems were found when looking at the overall periacetabular region. As a secondary outcome, less postoperative periacetabular bone loss occurred in the polar region when an isoelastic cup was used. Longer follow-up is required to allow for conclusions to be drawn about the long-term course of the 2 cup systems. Therapeutic Level I.

Revision of these THAs poses challenges unique to this implant type. The early complications after these revisions remain unreported as do the clinical and demographic factors associated with these complications. We describe (1) the frequency of early complications after revision of monoblock metal-on-metal THA; and (2) the clinical and demographic factors associated with complications. A review of our institution's total joint registry identified 107 patients who underwent 114 revisions of monoblock metal-on-metal THAs. Mean patient age at revision was 60 years (range, 17-84 years), and 65% of the patients were women. Mean followup after revision was 14 months (range, 0-122 months). Revision diagnoses included metallosis (51%), aseptic loosening (27%), infection (7%), pain (6%), malposition (4%), instability (3%), iliopsoas impingement (2%), and periprosthetic fracture (1%). Major complications (instability, infection, aseptic loosening, and wound complications) were documented and included in the analysis. Minor postoperative complications such as urinary tract infection were excluded. Twenty-three of 114 procedures (20%) involved at least one early complication after revision of monoblock metal-on-metal THA with 18 (16%) undergoing at least one additional subsequent surgery. The most common complications included aseptic loosening (6%), deep infection (6%), dislocation (4%), and acetabular fracture (3%). Patients who sustained a complication after revision surgery were older on average than those who did not (66 years versus 58 years, p=0.003). There were no differences in complication rate with respect to sex, time to revision, or revision diagnosis. Complications and reoperations occur frequently after revision for failed monoblock metal-on-metal THA (20% and 16%, respectively), and older patients appear to be at greater risk for complications after these revisions. Aseptic loosening, deep infection, and instability are all of great concern after revision and surgeons should be aware of these potential complications when undertaking revision of these THAs.

We report the outcomes of cementing a cementless dual mobility (DM) component into a stable acetabular shell for the treatment and/or prevention of instability in revision THA. Eighteen patients (18 THAs) undergoing revision THA with a specific monoblock DM construct cemented into a new acetabular component or an existing well-fixed component from 2011 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Tumor prostheses and total femoral replacements were excluded. In 9 patients (50%), components were implanted specifically for recurrent dislocations. Mean age was 64 years; mean follow-up was 3 years. Patients underwent an average of 4 prior hip operations (range 2-6). No cemented DM cups dissociated at the cement-cup interface. Three patients (17%) experienced a postoperative dislocation. One required a revision to constrained liner and 2 underwent open reduction with retention of the DM construct. Harris Hip Scores improved from 53 to 82 postoperatively (P < .001). Cementation of a monoblock cup DM construct, an off-label use as the construct is not specifically made for cementation, into a well-fixed acetabular component provides an alternative to enhance prosthetic stability in (1) recurrently dislocating THAs with well fixed, well-positioned acetabular components and (2) complex acetabular reconstructions in which constraint should be avoided.

Although DM bearing offers an easy solution avoiding the intraoperative and time-associated complications, concern about polyethylene wear and stability remains due to the difference regarding the design, the coverage angle and the clearance of the two implants. In order to evaluate the performance of this new solution with the new material to prevent the possibility of failure it is essential to conduct a review of the literature A qualitative systematic review of the literature has been conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Scopus for English and French articles between January 2000 and October 2019 was performed, with the primary objective of finding articles about dual mobility bearing coupling with large metal-on-metal cup in the case of hip revision procedure. Various combinations of the key words were used in the search strategy. Thirteen articles with DM bearing mated with MoM cup were analyzed. Of the 130 hip revisions selected, with a follow-up from 6 to 53 months, there were a total of 14 with complications (10.77%): four true dislocations (3.08%); six intra-prosthetic dislocations (IPD, 4.6%), two of which presented plastic deformation and polyethylene wear; four other complications (3.08%), included a cup osteolysis, a clicking noise, a superficial infection and a periprosthetic fracture. All the mentioned true dislocations occurred during the first month while IPDs appeared during the first two years from the index revision. In conclusion, according to the literature analyzed, we can stress that the concerns and doubts about mating a DM bearing with large MoM cup cannot be dissolved. It has been pointed out that a DM bearing is not designed for a MoM cup; it is not mechanically tested on MoM cups, which presents different clearance and coverage angles. Predictable complications may occur, such as IPD, polyethylene wear and true dislocation. These complications have been reported at an even higher rate than they were in the eighties, when the first generation of DM implants were of a lower quality of polyethylene and the characteristic of the design was less optimal than modern ones.",

        "abstract": "The articular surface replacement (ASR) monoblock metal-on-metal acetabular component was recalled due to a higher than expected early failure rate. We evaluated the survivorship of the device and variables that may be predictive of failure at a minimum of 5-year follow-up. A single-center, single-surgeon retrospective review was conducted in patients who received the DePuy Synthes ASR\u2122 XL Acetabular hip system from December 2005 to November 2009. Mean values and percentages were calculated and compared using the Fisher's exact test, simple logistic regression, and Student's t-test. The significance level was P \u2264 .05. This study included 29 patients (24 males, 5 females) with 32 ASR\u2122 XL acetabular hip systems. Mean age and body mass index (BMI) reached 55.2 years and 28.9 kg/m\u00b2, respectively. Mean postoperative follow-up was 6.2 years. A total of 2 patients (6.9%) died of an unrelated cause and 1 patient was lost to follow-up (3.4%), leaving 26 patients with 28 hip replacements, all of whom were available for follow-up. The 5-year revision rate was 34.4% (10 patients with 11 hip replacements). Mean time to revision was 3.1 years. Age (P = .76), gender (P = .49), BMI (P = .29), acetabular component abduction angle (P = .12), and acetabulum size (P = .59) were not associated with the increased rate for hip failure. Blood cobalt (7.6 vs 6.8 \u00b5g/L, P = .58) and chromium (5.0 vs 2.2 \u00b5g/L, P = .31) levels were not significantly higher in the revised group when compared with those of the unrevised group. In the revised group, a 91% decrease in cobalt and 78% decrease in chromium levels were observed at a mean of 6 months following the revision. This study demonstrates a high rate of failure of ASR acetabular components used in total hip arthroplasty at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up. No variable that was predictive of failure could be identified in this series. Close clinical surveillance of these patients is required.",

This retrospective, comparative study included patients older than 65 years who underwent hemiarthroplasty with a modular or monoblock distally fixed fluted stem and had failed treatment with proximal femoral nailing between 2012 and 2017, with at least a 2-year follow-up period. Radiographic and clinical evaluations of the groups were compared. The modular group comprised 22 males and 18 females with a mean age of 85.05\u00b17.1 years, and the monoblock group comprised 27 males and 17 females with a mean age of 83.27\u00b17.0 years. No significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the preoperative and final-visit Harris Hip Score and Parker and Palmer Mobility Score values (P>.05 for both). More patients showed osseous restoration in the monoblock group, but not to a significant level. The groups were similar regarding mortality rates. Stem length was greater in the modular group, but the proximal femoral part and stem size were similar in the groups (P<.05 for all). Canal filling at levels A, B, and C was negatively correlated (weak) with the proximal femoral bone restoration (P<.001 for all). Canal filling at level B was negatively correlated (weak) with the stress shielding of the femur (P<.05 for all). When comparing the modularity of the stem by minimizing the variations of both prostheses, such as brand and geometric design, there was no significant difference in either clinical or radiological evaluations.

        "abstract": "As the number of revision total hip arthroplasty increases, innovative solutions to complex problems are needed to address challenges posed by these complex cases. Severe acetabular bone loss, including cases of pelvic discontinuity, is a notable challenge with few solutions. Hip instability after revision arthroplasty remains one of the leading causes of revision and patient morbidity. The use of pelvic distraction and a press-fit tantalum shell for chronic discontinuity and posterior column open reduction and internal fixation with acetabular revision for acute pelvic discontinuity have previously been described. Similarly, dual mobility articulations have demonstrated long-term success in minimizing instability after revision total hip arthroplasty with good long-term survivorship. Here, the authors present a surgical technique in the management of Paprosky types 2 and 3 acetabular defects often with pelvic discontinuity using a tantalum shell in combination with cemented dual mobility liner to increase the stability of the joint. Custom screw placement is facilitated with the use of a metal cutting burr, both on the back table and in situ. The dual mobility liner is cemented, thus allowing for independent positioning of the acetabular implant and bearing surface. This technique has been successfully used in 19 patients with encouraging short-term results.",

        "abstract": "Instability remains a devastating complication following total hip arthroplasty. Here we describe a mini-posterior approach with a monoblock dual-mobility implant without \"traditional posterior hip precautions\" yielding excellent results. There were 580 consecutive hips in 575 patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty utilizing a monoblock dual-mobility implant and a mini-posterior approach. With this technique, the acetabular component positioning does not rely on tradition intra-operative radiographic abduction and anteversion goals but rather uses patient-specific anatomic landmarks (anterior acetabular rim and, when visible, the transverse acetabular ligament) to set cup position; stability is assessed with a significant, dynamic intra-operative test of range of motion. Patients' mean age was 64 years (range, 21 to 94), and 53.7% were women. Mean abduction was 48.4\u00b0 (range, 29\u00b0 to 68\u00b0) and mean anteversion was 24.7\u00b0 (range,\u00a0-1\u00b0 to 51\u00b0). Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scores improved in every measured domain from preoperative to final postoperative visit. There were seven (1.2%) patients who required reoperation, with mean time to reoperation of 1.3 months (range, one to 176 days). Only one patient (0.2%) who had a preoperative history of spinal cord injury and Charcot arthropathy dislocated. A posterior approach hip surgeon may want to consider using a monoblock dual-mobility construct and avoidance of traditional posterior hip precautions to achieve early hip stability with an extremely low dislocation rate and high patient satisfaction scores.",

Thirty-nine patients were included in this retrospective analysis undergoing conversion THA for failed cephalomedullary nail or dynamic hip screw fixation for intertrochanteric fractures from January 2017 to January 2022. The clinical evaluation was done using Harris hip score. The radiological outcomes measured were subsidence, level of osteointegration, stem-canal fill ratio and heterotopic bone formation. The complications were noted postoperatively and during the follow-up. The mean follow-up at the end of the study was 27.8\u00a0months (range, 14-72\u00a0months). There was a significant improvement in the Harris hip score over serial follow-ups (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but after 2\u00a0years, there was no statistically significant difference (p\u2009=\u20090.46). According to Engh's criteria, stable ingrowth was noted in 35 stems, fibrous stable ingrowth was noted in 4 stems and no patients had progressive subsidence and unstable stem. The mean stem-canal fill percentages were 91.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4% at the mid-stem and 80.3\u2009\u00b1\u200911.5% at the stem tip.

        "title": "Modular to Monoblock: Difficulties of Detaching the M(2)a-Magnum(TM) Head Are Common in Metal-on-metal Revisions.",
        "abstract": "Modern hip implants typically feature modular heads, which allow for easy exchange and removal from the femoral stem at the time of revision. However, owing to fretting, corrosion, or cold welding, the modular head may be difficult or impossible to separate from the underlying trunnion, especially if the implant has titanium interfaces between the head and the stem. We have repeatedly encountered difficulty removing the titanium sleeve adapter in the M(2)a-Magnum(TM) implant. Although the manufacturer warns about this complication and cases with these difficulties have been reported to the United States FDA, we believed this topic is important to study, because the frequency of difficulties in head removal is unknown and the complications related to this event have not been characterized. We asked: (1) Do revisions of M(2)a-Magnum(TM) implants differ from those of M(2)a-38(TM) implants in terms of ease of removal of the femoral head? (2) In cases where difficulty with M(2)a-Magnum(TM) head removal occurred, was the operative time, bleeding, risk of periprosthetic fracture, or joint infection increased compared with cases where the M(2)a-Magnum(TM) head was removed without difficulties? Between 2004 and 2014, we revised 296 THAs with metal-on-metal implants that involved M(2)a-Magnum(TM) (123) or M(2)a-38(TM) heads (88); of those, 84 were planned to include a femoral stem revision and insufficient data were available for three operations, so they were excluded from this analysis, leaving 124 THAs in the current retrospective study (70 THAs with M(2)a-Magnum(TM) and 54 THAs with M(2)a-38(TM) heads).The method of modular head removal, any difficulties removing the femoral head from the trunnion, operation time, and complications were recorded based on chart review. All the observed problems of detaching the head or taper adapter were among M(2)a-Magnum(TM) heads; there were no problems detaching the head in revisions of the M(2)a-38(TM) implant. In 29% (20 of 70) of revisions of the M(2)a-Magnum(TM) implant, the modular head could not be detached by knocking it with a punch and a mallet. Seventeen percent (12 of 70) of hips needed an unplanned stem revision owing to difficulties with head removal. In revisions of the M(2)a-Magnum(TM) implant that experienced head-removal problems, the median operative time was longer (144 minutes; range, 75-274 minutes) and bleeding was greater (725 mL; range, 300-2200 mL) compared with revisions of the M(2)a-Magnum(TM) implant without head removal problems (77 minutes, range, 33-197 minutes, p < 0.001; 475 mL, range, 50-1500 mL, p = 0.004). With the numbers available, we did not see differences in terms of the proportion of patients experiencing major complications (periprosthetic fracture or postoperative infections) between the groups (difficult versus easy; 25% [five of 20] versus 8% [four of 50]; odds ratio, 3.8 [95% CI, 0.9-16.2], p = 0.067). The titanium-titanium taper junction can be very difficult to separate during revision THAs, and if not anticipated, this problem can result in larger and more complicated revision procedures in patients who have the M(2)a-Magnum(TM) implant. Although the global use of metal-on-metal implants in THAs has decreased dramatically during the last several years, many thousands remain in service and therefore still might require revision. It is crucial to be prepared with special tools, including a femoral head extraction tool and diamond saw. The patient has to be informed of the possibility of a more extensive operation than preoperatively planned. Level III, therapeutic study.",

        "abstract": "Parallel to the increase in revision hip procedures surgeons face more and more complex anatomical challenges with pelvic discontinuity (PD) being one of the worst-case scenarios. Here we report on our clinical results using an asymmetric acetabular component for the treatment of PD. The implant is armed in a monoblock fashion with an extramedullary iliac flange and provides the possibility to augment it with an intramedullary iliac press-fit stem. In a single-center retrospective cohort study we analyzed prospectively collected data of 49 patients (35 female, 14 male) suffering from unilateral periprosthetic PD treated with an asymmetric acetabular component between 2009 and 2017. The mean follow-up was 71 months (21-114). Complications were documented and radiographic and functional outcomes were assessed. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a 5-year implant survival of 91% (confidence interval 77%-96%). The 5-year survival with revision for any cause was 87% (CI 74%-94%). The overall revision rate was 16% (n\u00a0= 8). Two patients required acetabular component revision due to aseptic loosening. Four patients (8%) suffered from periprosthetic infection: one patient was treated with a 2-stage revision, and another one with resection arthroplasty. The other 2 patients were treated with debridement, irrigation, and exchange of the mobile parts. Of 6 patients (12%) suffering from hip dislocation, 2 required implantation of a dual mobility acetabular component. The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 41 preoperatively to 79 at the latest follow-up (P < .001). Our findings demonstrate that an asymmetric acetabular component with extramedullary and optional intramedullary iliac fixation is a reliable and safe treatment method for periprosthetic PD resulting in good clinical and radiographic mid-term results.",

This study aims to compare stem subsidence across 3 modern TFT stems. Our secondary aim was to investigate the influence of bicortical contact or \"scratch fit\" on subsidence, as well as the role of intraoperative imaging in maximizing bicortical contact and preventing stem subsidence. A retrospective review of 271 hip arthroplasties utilizing modern TFT stems at a single institution was performed. Three stem designs were included in the analysis: 1 monoblock TFT stem (n\u00a0= 91) and 2 modular TFT stems (n\u00a0= 90; n\u00a0= 90). Patient demographics, Paprosky femoral bone loss classification, bicortical contact, utilization of intraoperative imaging, and stem subsidence (comparison of initial postoperative radiograph to the latest follow-up radiograph-minimum 3 months) were recorded. There was no statistically significant difference in overall subsidence (P\u00a0= .191) or the incidence of subsidence >5 millimeters between stems (P\u00a0= .126). Subgroup analysis based on femoral bone loss grading showed no difference in subsidence between stems. Increased bicortical contact was associated with reduced subsidence (P\u00a0= .004). Intraoperative imaging was used in 46.5% (126 of 271) of cases; this was not correlated with bicortical contact (P\u00a0= .673) or subsidence (P\u00a0= .521).

        "abstract": "Dual mobility (DM) total hip arthroplasty (THA) implants have been advocated for patients at risk for impingement due to abnormal spinopelvic mobility. Impingement against cobalt-chromium acetabular bearings, however, can result in notching of titanium femoral stems. This study investigated the incidence of femoral stem notching associated with DM implants and sought to identify risk factors. A multicenter retrospective study reviewed 256 modular and 32 monoblock DM components with minimum 1-year clinical and radiographic follow-up, including 112 revisions, 4 conversion THAs, and 172 primary THAs. Radiographs were inspected for evidence of femoral notching and to calculate acetabular inclination and anteversion. Revisions and dislocations were recorded. Ten cases of femoral notching were discovered (3.5%), all associated with modular cylindrospheric cobalt-chromium DM implants (P\u00a0= .049). Notches were first observed radiographically at mean 1.3 years after surgery (range 0.5-2.7 years). Notch location was anterior (20%), superior (60%), or posterior (20%) on the prosthetic femoral neck. Notch depth ranged from 1.7% to 20% of the prosthetic neck diameter. Eight cases with notching had lumbar pathology that can affect spinopelvic mobility. None of these notches resulted in stem fracture, at mean 2.7-year follow-up (range 1-7.6 years). There were no dislocations or revisions in patients with notching. Femoral notching was identified in 3.5% of DM cases, slightly surpassing the dislocation rate in a cohort selected for risk of impingement and instability. Although these cases of notching have not resulted in catastrophic failures thus far, further study of clinical sequelae is warranted. Component position, spinopelvic mobility, and implant design may influence risk.",

The aims of this paper were to assess: 1) the preoperative CT features of the dysplastic femurs; 2) survival rates, complications and reasons for revision; 3) the clinical outcomes; 4) the radiographic outcomes of single-taper conical stems in dysplasia (defined as center edge angle\u00a0<\u00a020\u00b0) at a long-term follow-up. Monoblock conical stem provides a 10-year survival rate of at least 95%, with excellent clinical outcomes and bony ingrowth. In total, 100 THAs in 85 patients (15 bilateral cases) were enrolled. The average age of the patients at surgery was 50.9\u00b111.5 years. Assessment of the native femoral morphology was performed using CT-scan, coronal (neck-shaft angle, offset, center of rotation position) and axial parameters (anteversion, mediolateral and anteroposterior femoral diameters).

All Metha stem implantations from 2004 to 2014 were recorded from the operation protocols (n\u00a0= 1888).

Data were complete for 93% of the procedures (1090 monoblock stems, 314 modular stems with titanium neck, and 230 modular stems with cobalt chrome neck). Mean follow-up was 6 years (1-11 years). Fifteen modular titanium implants were affected by cone fractures (4%). Therefore, monoblock, modular cobalt chrome, and modular titanium implants were analyzed separately. The 7-year revision rate for monoblock stems was 1.5%; for modular cobalt-chrome stems it was 1.8%, and for modular titanium stems it was 5.3%.

This study aims to analyze the ten\u00a0year survival rates and clinical outcome of one specific metaphyseal short hip stem implant. We retrospectively analyzed the patient records of the patients who underwent a total hip arthroplasty with a monoblock partial collum sparing metaphyseal short hip stem prosthesis in 2008 and 2009 in our clinic. Patients were contacted, and clinical follow-up was recorded using the German version of the modified Harris Hip Score. Furthermore, complications, revision surgery, and post-operative radiographs were analyzed. Data from 339 primary implantations in 322 patients were retrieved. The mean follow-up was 10.6\u00a0years. Seven patients underwent a revision. The ten\u00a0year survival rate with any revision surgery as the endpoint was 97.5%. The mean modified Harris Hip Score was 86 points (range 30 to 91 points). Five patients had an intraoperative fracture of the femur (1.6%). Two patients (0.6%) had a dislocation of the hip.

        "abstract": "Femoral bone loss is frequently encountered during revision total hip arthroplasty. The quality and quantity of remaining bone helps determine the best method for reconstruction. Extensively porous-coated cylindrical stems or titanium fluted tapered devices that achieve fixation in the diaphysis have both demonstrated excellent long-term survivorship. Titanium fluted tapered stems with a modular proximal body allow for more accurate leg length, offset, and version adjustments independent of the distal stem which may optimise hip biomechanics. Intraoperative fractures are more common with cylindrical stems and subsidence with tapered stems, particularly monoblock designs and in both dislocation continues to be one of the most common postoperative complications. In salvage situations in which an ectatic femoral canal is unable to support an uncemented device, impaction bone grafting, allograft-prosthetic composite, or a segmental proximal femoral replacement may be required.",

At a mean followup of 6.3 years (range, 6 months-10 years), the failure rate was 57%, more than 14 times higher than the rate typically seen with cemented polyethylene acetabular cups used with the STH stem. Failure was characterized by rapidly progressive acetabular or femoral osteolytic lesions that resulted in extensive bone loss, often in patients who had no symptoms. In addition to the debris that typically is generated by a metal on plastic bearing couple, an abundance of polyethylene particles of submicron size were produced at the cup-bone interface. Tissues retrieved from areas of osteolysis revealed the presence of intracellular submicron polyethylene particles in macrophages. It is recommended that patients with no symptoms who have RM noncemented, uncoated acetabular cups be followed up yearly and undergo early revision surgery when faced with osteolysis to prevent extensive bone loss.",

        "abstract": "Although 50 years have passed since Charnley started performing total hip arthroplasties, there are relatively few patient studies with a follow-up period of over 30 years. We studied radiograms of patients who had undergone Charnley total hip arthroplasty between 1975 and 1981 and evaluated the results at 26-35 years (mean 30.5 years) after the operation. The operations were performed in 87 joints of 82 patients (26 males and 56 females) aged 26-81 years (mean age 56 years) at the time of surgery. A monoblock-type Charnley stem with a 22-mm head was used in all patients. The stem had a matte satin surface finish and a flange or round-back shoulder. The socket was made of ultra-high-density polyethylene without a flange. All operations were performed by one surgeon using the original Charnley method in all patients, excluding the first five. Thirty years after the operation, 48 patients have died, 5 had an infection, 9 were lost to follow-up, and 20 patients with 24 joints are still alive. In 77 patients (82 joints), after excluding the 5 with infection, the socket and stem survival rates were 54 and 75% at 30 years after the operation when radiographic loosening or revision surgery was defined as the end point. With revision surgery as the end point, the rates were 68 and 82%, respectively. These results were as favorable as those with surgical techniques (including the first-generation cement technique) and implants in the early period. Although new techniques and implants have since been introduced, their long-term results should exceed those in this study. The results of this study should provide a valuable index with which to compare the long-term studies of current total hip arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of Poldi-\u010cech femoral stem implantation in primary total hip arthroplasty after 25 years. A group of 65 patients (90 hips) with Poldi-\u010cech total hip arthroplasty carried out between 1974 and 1984 was evaluated at the end of 2009. The mean follow-up of all patients was 28 years (25 to 35). There were seven men and 58 women. The mean age at the time of implantation was 43 years (26 to 60) and at the latest follow-up it was 72 years. In all patients the cemented UHMW PE acetabular component (RCH 1000) was used together with AKV Ultra 2 Poldi steel femoral stems (1st, 2nd and 3rd generations). The stem was a monoblock with a 32-mm head. The evaluation of the results was based on the Harris hip score and X ray with an A-P view of the pelvis and the affected hip. Statistical analysis was made using the life-table method. At the latest follow up the mean Harris score was 69.7 points (40 to 88). There were 69 hips with an original Poldi-\u010cech femoral component still in situ, 64 of them were stable and five with radiological evidence of aseptic loosening. Five patients had undergone Girdlestone resection arthroplasty for septic loosening. Thirteen patients (16 hips) had femoral stem revision. The cumulative proportion of clinical survivorship of the Poldi-\u010cech femoral stem, with revision for any reason as the endpoint, .was 0.93 at 6 years, 0.84 at 12 years, and 0.77 at 18, 24 and 30 years after the index surgery. Radiographic findings revealed 64 hips with stable stems, five hips with ;aseptic loosening (probable, 0 possible, 2, definite, 3). Six- teen hips were after revision surgery for aseptic loosening of the stem and five hips were after Girdlestone resection arthroplasty for septic failure. The cumulative proportion of radiological survivorship of the Poldi-\u010cech femoral stem with any reason as the endpoint was 0.92 at 6 years, 0.78 at 12 years, 0.72 at 18 years, 0.69 at 24 years and 0.69 at 30 years. The Poldi-\u010cech stem with its anatomical shape and a highly polished surface meets the principles of successful composite beam stems. Its disadvantage is a valgus neck- shaft angle of 140\u00b0 giving lower femoral offset and the risk of development of valgus deformity of the ipsilateral knee. In most cases osteolysis, radiolucent lines and bone rarefaction of the femur resulted from polyethylene wear of the acetabular component. This study demonstrates a long-term survivorship of the Poldi-\u010cech femoral component in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty 25 to 35 years ago.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy of contemporary monoblock dual-mobility (DM) cups to prevent dislocations in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is well reported, but there is little published data on their mid- to long-term outcomes. The authors aimed at reporting the 10-year survival of a contemporary DM cup as well as its clinical and radiographic outcomes. From a retrospective consecutive multicentric series of 516 patients (541 hips) that received uncemented THA between June 2007 and June 2010, 6 patients (6 hips) had cup and stem revisions, 5 patients (5 hips) had isolated stem revision, and 2 patients (2 hips) had isolated insert revision. A total of 103 patients (111 hips) died with their original implants, and 41 patients (42 hips) were lost to follow-up. This left 358 patients (375 hips) for clinical assessment at a median follow-up of 8.7 years (range, 6.8-10.5 years), including 279 patients (290 hips) with postoperative radiographs. Implant survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariable analyses were performed to determine whether clinical outcomes are associated with patient or surgical factors. The 10-year survival considering revision for aseptic loosening as end point was 100% for the cup and 99.2% for the stem. No dislocations were observed, and radiographic assessment revealed 1 acetabular granuloma (0.3%), but no radiolucencies nor fractures. The Harris hip score improved from 49.6 \u00b1 15.5 to 85.2 \u00b1 14.5, and the postoperative Oxford hip score was 19.2 \u00b1 7.6. Multivariable analyses revealed that improvement in Harris hip score increased with cup diameter (beta, 1.28; P\u00a0= .039). Our data confirmed satisfactory midterm outcomes of uncemented THA using a contemporary DM cup, with no dislocations nor cup revisions due to aseptic loosening.

        "abstract": "Whereas femoral component modularity allows the surgeon to address a variety of femoral defects in complex total hip arthroplasty (THA), breakage of modular stems is a known complication that typically occurs at the taper junction. In response, a proprietary process of taper roller-hardening that increases taper strength by a factor of 3.5 was introduced in 1999. The authors reviewed a consecutive series of patients by a single surgeon who underwent cementless revision or difficult primary THA with a taper roller-hardened modular calcar replacement prosthesis, and have the potential for a minimum of two-year follow up. In 116 patients, 123 hips were involved. Two surgeries were primary, 101 were revision/conversion, 18 were for reimplantation after treatment of infection, and two were intramedullary total femur constructs, one of which was a reimplantation after sepsis. The patients' ages at surgery averaged 71 years, and BMIs averaged 28.12 kg/m2. Nine of the patients, all with single hip involvement, were lost to contact. Twenty-one patients, three of whom had bilateral hip involvement, expired during the follow-up period with implant outcome known. Follow up in the patients who survived averaged 44 (range: 18-78) months. Six femoral components have been revised: two (1.6%) due to recurrent sepsis, three (2.4%) due to sepsis, one (0.8%) from periprosthetic fracture, and none from septic loosening or component breakage. Survivorship with aseptic loosening as the end-point was 100%. In this series, roller-hardening appears to improve the durability of the tapered junction. No roller-hardened modular calcar devices have failed due to component breakage. However, their use is not recommended in the totally deficient proximal femur, as fatigue breaks of distally fixed monoblock extensively coated stems have been reported. Caution is advised when potting or anchoring any stem in the femoral diaphysis without reconstituting proximal bone stock and support.",

        "abstract": "There is no consensus about the necessity of exchanging a stable femoral component during revision total hip arthroplasty (RTHA) when only the acetabular component requires replacement. Sparing the femoral component reduces morbidity, but can make acetabular replacement technically more difficult. Moreover, the outcome of the retained femoral component is also a question, especially with older implants. Isolated acetabular component RTHA results in lower surgical morbidity, and does not increase the risk of later femoral complications. Eighty-nine patients, mean age 68, underwent surgery (anterior approach on traction table) for isolated acetabular component revision between 1994 and 2005. The femoral component had been implanted a mean 10.5 years before revision. Fifteen patients died, mean age 84.5. Eleven patients, mean age 81.3, were lost to follow-up and four underwent revision due to a subsequent infection (range 14 months - 11 years). Fifty-nine patients were evaluated after a mean 8.6 years (range 4 - 15 years). At follow-up the mean Harris score was 89.2 [IC=6.89; 44 - 100] and the mean Merle d'Aubign\u00e9 score was 15.3 [IC=1.57; 11 - 18]. Five patients (5.6%) underwent surgery again due to postoperative dislocation. Six patients underwent surgery for recurrent acetabular loosening due to allograft resorption. The size of the bone defects did not increase the risk of these failures (P>0.6). Fractures occurred in two femoral components 6 and 9 years after revision. Polyethylene wear occurred in three patients requiring two repeat revisions at 6 and 7 years. In both cases the femoral component included a titanium head, which caused the wear. Implant survival at 8.6 years was 85.16 \u00b1 0.117% all causes of revision combined, 88.47 \u00b1 0.113% if infectious causes were excluded and 93.6 \u00b1 0.07% if only cases of acetabular component failure were taken into account. Intermediate term outcomes are satisfactory if stable femoral components are retained. Nevertheless, this procedure should be performed in situations of correctly oriented modular components. In single piece (monoblock) femoral implants, or in implants with a history of failure, this technique should be restricted to elderly and/or fragile patients. Level IV, Retrospective study.",

The patients were followed with repeated radiostereometric analysis for 2 years to assess migration. At 2 years, stem retroversion was 2.3\u00b0 and 0.7\u00b0 (p < 0.001) and posterior translation was 0.44 mm and 0.17 mm (p = 0.002) for the Charnley group (n = 26) and the Spectron EF group (n = 74), respectively. Subsidence was 0.26 mm for the Charnley and 0.20 mm for the Spectron EF (p = 0.5). The Spectron EF femoral stem was more stable than the Charnley flanged 40 stem in our study when evaluated at 2 years. In a report from the Norwegian arthroplasty register, the Spectron EF stem had a higher revision rate due to aseptic loosening beyond 5 years than the Charnley. Initial stability is not invariably related to good long-term results. Our results emphasize the importance of prospective long-term follow-up of prosthetic implants in clinical trials and national registries and a stepwise introduction of implants.",

The 81 patients with median age of 79\u2009years (70-91) were available for whole blood metal ion analysis. The levels of Co, Cr, Ni and Zr in the blood were generally low with all the head materials (medians <0.3 micrograms/L) and no statistical difference between the groups were found (p\u00a0=\u00a0.2-.8).

        "abstract": "Several different designs of hemiarthroplasty are used to treat intracapsular fractures of the proximal femur, with large variations in costs. No clinical benefit of modular over monoblock designs has been reported in the literature. Long-term data are lacking. The aim of this study was to report the ten-year implant survival of commonly used designs of hemiarthroplasty. Patients recorded by the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) between 1 September 1999 and 31 December 2020 who underwent hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of a hip fracture with the following implants were included: a cemented monoblock Exeter Trauma Stem (ETS), cemented Exeter V40 with a bipolar head, a monoblock Thompsons prosthesis (Cobalt/Chromium or Titanium), and an Exeter V40 with a Unitrax head. Overall and age-defined cumulative revision rates were compared over the ten years following surgery. A total of 41,949 hemiarthroplasties were included. Exeter V40 with a Unitrax head was the most commonly used (n = 20,707, 49.4%). The overall rate of revision was small. A total of 28,201 patients (67.2%) were aged > 80 years. There were no significant differences in revision rates across all designs of hemiarthroplasty in patients of this age at any time. The revision rates for all designs were < 3.5%, three years postoperatively. At subsequent times the ETS and Exeter V40 with a bipolar head performed well in all age groups. The unadjusted ten-year mortality rate for the whole cohort was 82.2%. There was no difference in implant survival between all the designs of hemiarthroplasty in the first three years following surgery, supporting the selection of a cost-effective design of hemiarthroplasty for most patients with an intracapsular fracture of the hip, as determined by local availability and costs. Beyond this, the ETS and Exeter bipolar designs performed well in all age groups.",

Although first generation components had limited survivorship and diminished clinical outcomes, subsequent designs have proven much better with rates of aseptic loosening of 2% to 5%, and good clinical scores. Titanium is the favored substrate metal for these components because of its bone affinity and low modulus of elasticity. A series of 107 consecutive revisions of standard stems is presented using a calcar replacement long stem design with an overall 92.7% 11-year survivorship. Bone ingrowth was achieved in all but two components. Radiographic stress shielding was seen in 11.4% with 42.6% having some calcar healing. These implants can be used in most revision situations, but require sufficient proximal metaphysis of the femur to provide support of the component. Supplemental allograft may need to be used. These implants require a tight fit in the isthmus of the femur and fill of the proximal femur. Modularity makes achieving this easier, but monoblock designs also can be successful.",

The aim of this study was to compare ion levels and rate of ARMD between patients sharing the same MoM bearing but 1 group having monoblock stems versus another having modular stems. Whole blood cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) ion concentrations, ARMD rate, revision rate, and function measured by UCLA and WOMAC scores were compared between groups. ARMD rate was significantly higher in the modular group (46%) compared with the monoblock group (16%, p = 0.031). Revision for ARMD was performed at 52.8 \u00b1 8.1\u2009months in the modular group versus 98.2 \u00b1 15.5\u2009months after primary THA in the monoblock group. ARMD originated from wear and corrosion of the junction between stem and femoral head adapter sleeve in all monoblock cases, and the junction between stem and modular neck in all the modular ones. Cr and Co ions levels were significantly higher in the modular stem group ( p < 0.001 for both). Although both groups had MoM bearings, corrosion at stem/neck or neck/head junctions combining dissimilar metal (Ti and Cr-Co) was seen as the source of excess metal ions release leading to ARMD. Poor performance of the modular junction may be more deleterious than wear of the bearing. To avoid such complications, THA femoral stem modular junctions should be eliminated (return to a full monoblock implant) or have improved junction design.",

        "abstract": "This study reports the mid-term results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a monoblock acetabular component with a large-diameter head (LDH) ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearing. Of the 276 hips (246 patients) included in this study, 264 (96%) were reviewed at a mean of 67 months (48 to 79) postoperatively. Procedures were performed with a mini posterior approach. Clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded at regular intervals. A noise assessment questionnaire was completed at last follow-up. There were four re-operations (1%) including one early revision for insufficient primary fixation (0.4%). No hip dislocation was reported. The mean University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score, 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) Mental Component Summary (MCS) score, SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) were 6.6 (2 to 10), 52.8 (25.5 to 65.7), 53.0 (27.2 to 66.5), 7.7 (0 to 63), and 88.5 (23 to 100), respectively. No signs of loosening or osteolysis were observed on radiological review. The incidence of squeaking was 23% (n = 51/225). Squeaking was significantly associated with larger head diameter (p < 0.001), younger age (p < 0.001), higher SF-12 PCS (p < 0.001), and UCLA scores (p < 0.001). Squeaking did not affect patient satisfaction, with 100% of the squeaking hips satisfied with the surgery. LDH CoC THAs have demonstrated excellent functional outcomes at medium-term follow-up, with very low revision rate and no dislocations. The high incidence of squeaking did not affect patient satisfaction or function. LDH CoC with a monoblock acetabular component has the potential to provide long term implant survivorship with unrestricted activity, while avoiding implant impingement, liner fracture at insertion, and hip instability.

        "abstract": "Bone preservation and long-term survival are the main challenges in cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA). A good bone stock is especially important for adequate anchorage of the cup in revision cases. However, the optimal acetabular cup design for preserving good bone stock is still unclear. We aimed to compare clinical outcome, radiological alterations, migration, and wear at mid-term for two different cup types. This retrospective matched-pair study was performed using the data for 98 THA cases treated with a monoblock cup composed of vitamin E-blended highly cross-linked polyethylene (VEPE; monoblock group) or a modular cup composed of a highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) without an antioxidant (modular group). Clinical results were evaluated using the Harris Hip Score (HHS). The obtained radiographs were analyzed for radiological alterations, migration, and wear using Einzel-Bild-R\u00f6ntgen-Analyse (EBRA) software. The mean follow-up duration was 73.2\u2009\u00b1\u200919.2\u00a0months (range: 32-108\u00a0months) and 60.5\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2\u00a0months (range: 20-84\u00a0months) in the monoblock and modular groups, respectively. HHS improved to 95.7 points in the monoblock group and 97.6 points in the modular group, without significant differences (p\u2009=\u20090.425). EBRA measurements were obtained in all cases. Acetabular bone alterations were not detected on radiological assessments. Mean cup migration was 1.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.92\u00a0mm (range: 0.46-3.94\u00a0mm) and 1.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.87\u00a0mm (range: 0.22-3.62\u00a0mm) in the monoblock and modular groups. The mean wear rate was 0.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\u00a0mm (range: 0.00-0.70\u00a0mm) and 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\u00a0mm (range: 0.00-0.50\u00a0mm) in the monoblock and modular groups. Both migration and wear pattern showed no significant differences (p\u2009=\u20090.741 and 0.243). None of the cases required revision surgery, yielding an implant survival rate of 100% in both groups. The isoelastic press-fit monoblock VEPE cup and modular metal-back HXLPE cup showed equivalent mid-term wear and cup migration. Long-term studies are required to determine the effects of modularity, isoelasticity, and polyethylene stabilization with vitamin E on cup loosening and survival rates.",

        "abstract": "Some data indicate that first-generation highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) can oxidise in vivo and is associated with reduced mechanical properties. To overcome these limitations, a natural anti-oxidant vitamin E has been added to HXLPE to preserve the mechanical properties and decrease oxidative degradation whilst conserving high wear resistance. We hypothesised that after a minimal three\u00a0years of follow-up the use of vitamin E-blended HXLPE would result in lower radiographic wear when compared with ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). One hundred patients were randomised to receive hybrid total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a monoblock cementless acetabular component made either of UHMWPE or vitamin E-blended HXLPE. All other parameters were identical in both groups. Complete follow-up was available for 74 of these patients. Femoral head penetration was measured using a validated computer-assisted method. The median creep measured 0.111\u00a0mm (range, -0.576 - +0.444\u00a0mm) in the vitamin E-blended group versus 0.170\u00a0mm (range, -0.861 - +0.884\u00a0mm) in the UHMWPE group (difference of medians, 0.059; p\u2009=\u20090.046). The median steady state penetration rate was -0.008\u00a0mm/year (range, -0.88 - +0.64\u00a0mm/year) in the vitamin E-blended group versus 0.133\u00a0mm/year (range, -0.84 - +0.85\u00a0mm/year) in the UHMWPE group (difference of medians 0.141, p\u2009=\u20090.043). This study demonstrated that femoral head penetration was lower when using vitamin E-blended HXLPE when compared with UHMWPE, with a steady-state penetration rate far below the osteolysis threshold. Longer-term follow-up is needed to warrant whether wear reduction will generate less occurrence of osteolysis and aseptic loosening.",

        "abstract": "Dual mobility (DM) has been shown to improve stability both in primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) and is increasingly used in patients at high risk of dislocation and in the treatment of THA instability. The introduction of modular liners has helped to overcome some of the limitations of monoblock DM cups. In this context, the use of a ceramic liner would avoid the conventional cobalt-chromium liner in the titanium shell, which can be problematic in some situations. The aim of this paper is to report the outcomes of a consecutive series of patients undergoing revision THA using a modular DM cup with a ceramic liner instead of the conventional metal one, and to clarify the rationale for this currently \"off-label\" use. This is a retrospective series of patients who received this new DM bearing in a single institution. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically at 1\u2009month, 3\u2009months, 6\u2009months and yearly thereafter. 5 patients received the ceramic liner in the study period (2014-2019). The indications were instability or high risk of dislocation in ceramic liner fracture and ARMD with soft tissue damage after MoM THA. The mean age at surgery was 74 (63-82) years, the mean follow-up was 36 (12-72) months. No dislocation occurred, and no adverse events related to the implant were recorded. The use of a ceramic liner in a modular DM cup offers several advantages in selected patients, and the results of our cohort are encouraging. However, caution is needed in introducing this new bearing because knowledge is currently limited. Further studies on a larger number of patients and with longer follow-ups are needed to confirm these findings and before widespread use of the device.",

        "abstract": "The dual mobility cup (DMC) reduces the dislocation rates in total hip arthroplasty (THA). DMC systems include anatomical (non-modular or monoblock) (ADM) and modular dual mobility (MDM) components (Stryker Orthopaedics, Mahwah, NJ, USA). This review aims to assess differences between these two types of DMC implants concerning dislocation and revision rates, as well as patient-reported outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reports data from patients undergoing primary THA using MDM and/or ADM implants. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed articles from Science Direct/Scopus, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We compared dislocation rates, revisions for any reason, aseptic loosening, infections, fractures, and functional outcomes between ADM and MDM components. Eleven studies were considered eligible for further analysis. A total of 3369 patients (mean age\u2009=\u200965.4\u00a0years) underwent primary THA, including 3386 DMC implants. The mean follow-up for the MDM and ADM groups was 2.9\u00a0years and 3.9\u00a0years, respectively. The study revealed one dislocation in the MDM and none in the ADM. By proportion metanalysis, the review did not show statistical differences in all-cause revisions (p\u2009=\u20090.93, [CI [0.01;0.02]) or periprosthetic fractures (p\u2009=\u20090.18, CI [0.01;0.02]). MDM and ADM systems, both, represent safe DM options regarding dislocation, all-causes revisions and functional outcomes.",

        "title": "A cementless elastic monoblock socket in young patients: a ten to 18-year clinical and radiological follow-up.",
        "abstract": "The survival of acetabular components depends on several factors: wear, osteolysis and septic or aseptic loosening. Osteolysis seems to be the main cause for concern in cementless arthroplasties. Acetabular osteolysis results from particle debris and segmental unloading of acetabular bone by rigid sockets. We investigated a cementless elastic monoblock socket with regard to acetabular osteolysis and aseptic loosening in a cohort of young patients. We evaluated 158 hip arthroplasties with a minimum follow-up of ten\u00a0years (ten to 18) and a mean age of 42\u00a0years (18-50). The overall revision rate at 14\u00a0years was 80% with a 98% survival rate for aseptic loosening. The mean polyethylene wear rate was 0.11\u00a0mm/year. Progressive acetabular osteolysis was seen in 3% of patients evaluated. In conclusion, we found low pelvic osteolysis rates, acceptable overall wear rates, satisfactory overall survival and excellent survival rates for aseptic loosening of a cementless elastic monoblock socket in patients younger than 50\u00a0years. Ongoing tribology developments and knowledge about acetabular bone adaptations behind acetabular implants will further lower wear and osteolysis rates and optimise survival rates of cementless sockets.",

        "abstract": "Revision of failed modular metal-on-metal total hip replacement (MoM-THA) can be technically difficult. A dual mobility liner can help to salvage a well-fixed acetabular component. The present paper reports the clinical and radiographic outcome of revision of failed Birmingham modular MoM-THA using a dual mobility liner. The present study reports on ten patients (3 female and 7 male) with 11 revision THAs. Patients underwent revision an average of 51\u00a0months (range 40-73\u00a0months) after index procedure. Mean follow-up after the revision was 31\u00a0months (range 24-37\u00a0months) and all patients underwent an MRI with metal artifact reduction software (MARS) at least two\u00a0years after revision to assess for local polyethylene wear and osteolysis. The Harris Hip score improved from 92.2 (range 63.0-100.0) to 100.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.072). One patient had a one-time dislocation within seven\u00a0days of surgery. No patient required additional surgeries. Radiographs showed no signs of component loosening and osteolysis and MRI imaging revealed no evidence of polyethylene wear or osteolysis. A dual mobility liner in an existing Birmingham cup can provide excellent clinical and radiological short-term results without MRI evidence of increased polyethylene wear.

At a minimum of 9.6 years postoperatively (average, 10.3 years; SD, 0.2 years; range, 9.6-10.8 years), a helical CT scan of the pelvis using a metal suppression protocol was obtained. This scan was evaluated for the presence of osteolysis. We found no evidence of osteolysis on CT scan at an average of 10.3 years.

        "abstract": "For over 10 years, the RM Pressfit cup\u2122 has been used in our department. This is a one-piece, elastic, cementless implant designed with standard polyethylene (PE), covered with a thin coating of titanium particles. To date, there is no French study evaluating this cup after more than 10 years. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study in order to: (1) evaluate the survival of the implant with a minimum follow-up of 10 years, (2) evaluate the functional scores at the last follow-up, (3) measure the wear of the PE, (4) identify radiological loosening, (5) search for risk factors for cup removal, (6) identify complications that required management in the operating theatre. The working hypothesis was that the survival of this implant was greater than 95% at 10 years' follow-up, in accordance with the criteria of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). This was a retrospective monocentric study, including adult patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) with an RM Pressfit cup\u2122 (28\u2009mm friction size) for coxarthrosis (primary or secondary) or femoral head osteonecrosis. Exclusion criteria were a follow-up period of less than 10 years, the placement of an RM Pressfit cup\u2122 as a secondary intention for a THA (n\u2009=\u20095) or following a trochanteric fracture (n\u2009=\u20091). In total, 163 patients (182 hips) with a median age (Q1-Q3) of 63 (56-68) years, and a sex ratio (M/F) of 1.7 were included. Functional scores were evaluated using the Harris and Oxford scores. Radiographs were analyzed in the immediate postoperative period and at the last follow-up. The median follow-up was 10.5 (10-11.5) years. Of the 182 included hips, 7 cups were removed, corresponding to a 10-year survival rate of 96.1% (95% CI [93.3; 96.9]). The median Harris and Oxford scores at 10.5\u2009years were 95 (90-98) and 19 (17-23) points, respectively. The median PE wear rate was 0.058 (0.039-0.087) mm/year. Univariate analysis showed that male gender was associated with PE wear (OR\u2009=\u20093.6; 95% CI [1.3; 12.9] [p\u2009=\u20090.012]). Ten cups (6%) showed radiological instability with migration greater than 3\u2009mm and/or variation in inclination greater than 8\u2009\u00b0, and only 9 hips (6%) showed bone resorption. No preoperative or perioperative factors analyzed were associated with cup removal. Dislocation accounted for 71% (n\u2009=\u20095) of the causes of cup removal. Additionally, 6 hips experienced at least one dislocation episode requiring reduction by external maneuvers in the operating room, bringing the overall dislocation rate in the series to 6% (n\u2009=\u200911). Increased cup inclination was the only risk factor for prosthetic dislocation (OR\u2009=\u20091.2; 95% CI [1.09; 1.4] [p\u2009=\u20090.0003]). Overall complications requiring surgical intervention included 15 (8.3%) implanted cups (7 removed cups, 6 dislocation episodes requiring reduction by external maneuvers in the operating room, and 2 hips reoperated for washing and changing of mobile components due to early infection). The RM Pressfit cup\u2122 gives good long-term clinical and radiological results with an overall survival of 96.1% and a low complication rate over 10 years. Over the last 2 years the RM Vitamys\u2122 cup has been introduced allowing the use of 32\u2009mm femoral head diameter for size 48 cups, to reduce the risk of dislocation.

        "abstract": "The risk of early complications is high after monoblock acetabular metal-on-metal (MoM) THA revisions. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding clinical complications after isolated head-liner exchange of modular MoM THA. The purposes of this study were (1) to describe the frequency of early complications after an isolated head-liner exchange revision of modular MoM THA; and (2) to determine whether patients who experienced complications or dislocation after head-liner exchanges had higher serum chromium (Cr) or cobalt (Co) ion levels than those who did not. A review of our institution's total joint registry retrospectively identified 53 patients who underwent 54 liner exchange revisions of a modular acetabular MoM THA. The study period was from April 2008 to April 2016 at a single tertiary care center. During this period, isolated head-liner exchanges (rather than more extensive revisions) were performed in patients if they did not have evidence of loosening of the acetabular or femoral components. Reasons for revision surgery included pain, mechanical symptoms, radiographic evidence of osteolysis, elevated serum metal ions, and MRI abnormalities with 40 of the 54 hips having pain or mechanical symptoms and 38 of 54 hips having multiple reasons for revision before surgery. Patients were excluded if they did not meet the minimum postrevision followup or had the modular liner exchange secondary to infection. All revisions were from a single manufacturer with one head-liner exchange of a MoM THA from another manufacturer excluded during the study period. The mean time from index MoM THA to modular exchange was 96 (SD \u00b1 36) months. Because the focus of this study was early complications, we had a minimum 90-day followup duration for inclusion. Mean followup after revision was 15 months (SD \u00b1 12); a total of 56% (30 of 54) had followup of at least 12 months' duration. Complications (dislocation, infection) and reoperations were obtained by chart review performed by individuals other than the treating physician(s). Serum metal ion levels were obtained before head-liner exchange. The median serum Cr and Co levels were 6 \u00b5g/L (range, 0-76 \u00b5g/L) and 12 \u00b5g/L (range, 0-163 \u00b5g/L), respectively. Of the 54 revision THAs, 15 (28%) developed complications. Nine (17%) occurred within 90 days of the revision surgery and 11 (20%) resulted in reoperation. The most common complication was dislocation (12 of 54 [22%]) with recurrent dislocation noted in eight of these 12 patients. All patients with recurrent dislocation continued to dislocate and underwent repeat revision. Patients with dislocation had higher median serum Cr and Co ion levels than those without dislocation (Cr: 24 [range, 11-76] versus 4 [range, 0-70], p = 0.001 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 10-57]; Co: 41 [range, 6-163] versus 8 [range, 0-133], p = 0.016 [95% CI, 6-141]). Three (6%) of the 54 patients underwent repeat surgery for deep space infection. Complications and reoperations are common after modular head-liner exchange in the setting of a failed MoM THA. Our study likely underestimates the frequency of complications and revisions because the followup period in this report was relatively short. Dislocation is the most common complication and elevated serum metal ion levels may be a predictor of dislocation. These findings are concerning and surgeons should be aware of the high complication risk associated with this procedure. Level IV, therapeutic study.",

        "title": "Restoring the femoral offset prevent early migration of the stem in total hip arthroplasty: an EBRA-FCA study.",
        "abstract": "The use of modular stems is still debated and controversial. Some authors have highlighted a number of disadvantages of modular prostheses including high costs, the tendency to fracture, the fretting and corrosion and the increased production of debris. Other authors have emphasized several advantages to adapt the prosthesis to the morphometric differences of patients, to allow better accuracy in restoring the anatomy and biomechanics of hip joint. The advantages of the modular devices appear to be more evident in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). In our study we compared 96 patients, operated for arthritis of the hip with 55 modular neck prostheses (PROFEMUR\u00ae, Wright\u00ae Arlington, Tennesse, USA) and 41 standard femoral stems (SYMAX\u00ae, Striker\u00ae Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA). The precision of restoring the natural offset during surgery was correlated with the clinical outcome and the radiological early migration of each stem measured using the computer-assisted EBRA-FCA method. The average preoperative HHS (Harris Hip Score) was 44 (23-66); the postoperative 86.56 in the 55 patients operated with modular prostheses and 81.70 in the 41 patients with monoblock stem. The worst HH Scores were seen in patients in whom the offset was not restored properly. On the contrary, the best scores have been reached in patients in which that value is closer to the \u0093target\u0094 value (offset value of the contralateral hip). Restoring the proper offset seems to determine an appropriate tension of the abductor muscles of the hip and implies a better functioning of the joint and a better primary stability of the implant, with less early migration. This has to be a primary objective of THA surgery.",

        "abstract": "Retention of the acetabular component is an option during conversion from hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) to total hip arthroplasty (THA). The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes of conversion of the femoral resurfacing component with retained acetabular components (RAC) and use of dual-mobility femoral heads to outcomes of patients treated with both component (BC) revisions. A retrospective review was performed of the clinical outcomes of HRA to THA conversions performed at a single institution between 2008 and\u00a02017. Seventy-one conversions were included (27 RAC and 44 BC). Average age at time of conversion was 54.4 years (range, 30-68 years). Median time to conversion was 5.14 (2.77-7.41) years and median follow-up post-conversion was 1.7 (0.33-4.0) years. There were no significant differences in indications for conversion between the 2 groups with the majority performed for complications related to elevated metal ions and aseptic loosening. Harris Hip Scores improved from pre-conversion to post-conversion in both cohorts (P < .01). There were no significant differences in pre-conversion and post-conversion metal ion levels between the RAC and BC groups. Serum metal ion levels decreased significantly in both cohorts (P\u00a0< .01). There were 6 additional revisions in the cohort (4 in BC, 2 in RAC) at a median 2.94 (1.99-3.85) years post-conversion. Two RAC patients had intraprosthetic dislocations with extensive polyethylene wear requiring acetabular revision at median 3.92 (3.85-3.98) years post-conversion. Overall, there were a higher number of complications in the BC group related to acetabular fracture, failure of osseointegration, and periprosthetic joint infection; however, this did not reach statistical significance (P\u00a0= .27). Salvage of an appropriately positioned, well-fixed HRA acetabular component is a reasonable option in the setting of conversion to THA using dual-mobility components. This technique avoids the morbidity of acetabular revision and was associated with a decrease in metal ion levels and improvements in short-term functional outcomes comparable to a BC revision.",

        "abstract": "Uncemented metal acetabular components show good osseointegration, but material stiffness causes stress shielding and retroacetabular bone loss. Cemented monoblock polyethylene components load more physiologically; however, the cement bone interface can suffer fibrous encapsulation and loosening. It was hypothesized that an uncemented titanium-sintered monoblock polyethylene component may offer the optimum combination of osseointegration and anatomical loading. A total of 38 patients were prospectively enrolled and received an uncemented monoblock polyethylene acetabular (pressfit) component. This single cohort was then retrospectively compared with previously reported randomized cohorts of cemented monoblock (cemented) and trabecular metal (trabecular) acetabular implants. The primary outcome measure was periprosthetic bone density using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry over two years. Secondary outcomes included radiological and clinical analysis. Although there were differences in the number of males and females in each group, no significant sex bias was noted (p = 0.080). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in age (p = 0.910) or baseline lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) (p = 0.998) found between any of the groups (pressfit, cemented, or trabecular). The pressfit implant initially behaved like the trabecular component with an immediate fall in BMD in the inferior and medial regions, with preserved BMD laterally, suggesting lateral rim loading. However, the pressfit component subsequently showed a reversal in BMD medially with recovery back towards baseline, and a continued rise in lateral BMD. This would suggest that the pressfit component begins to reload the medial bone over time, more akin to the cemented component. Analysis of postoperative radiographs revealed no pressfit component subsidence or movement up to two years postoperatively (100% interobserver reliability). Medial defects seen immediately postoperatively in five cases had completely resolved by two years in four patients. Initially, the uncemented monoblock component behaved similarly to the rigid trabecular metal component with lateral rim loading; however, over two years this changed to more closely resemble the loading pattern of a cemented polyethylene component with increasing medial pelvic loading. This indicates that the uncemented monoblock acetabular component may result in optimized fixation and preservation of retroacetabular bone stock. Cite this article: ",

        "abstract": "Modular or custom-made femoral components have been preferred for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with a history of Perthes' disease because of the distortion in the anatomy of the proximal femur. However, it has not been established whether a monobloc cementless stem will fit the distorted proximal femur or whether the results of the procedure are satisfactory in this group of patients. We reviewed 68 consecutive patients who had undergone THA for childhood Perthes' disease between June 2003 and December 2008. There were 35 men and 33 women with a mean age of 48 years (16 to 73) at the time of index arthroplasty. Their mean body mass index was 24.4 (18.3 to 32.9). Of the 68 hips, 32 were classified as Stulberg class III and 36 as class IV. The mean pre-operative shortening of the affected leg was 17.2 mm (5 to 34). The minimum follow-up was five years (mean 8.5 years; 5.2 to 10). An intra-operative calcar fracture occurred in eight hips (11.8%) and was successfully treated by cerclage wiring. The mean stem version was 14.6\u00b0 (-2.3 to 30; standard deviation (sd) 7.3). The mean acetabular component abduction was 40.2\u00b0 (23.7 to 56.0; sd 6.5) and the mean anteversion 28.3\u00b0 (6.4 to 43.0; sd 7.6), respectively. The mean follow-up was 8.5 years (5.2 to 10). No dislocations occurred and no hips were revised during the course of the study. At final follow-up, the mean Harris Hip Score was 91 points (59 to 100) and the mean University of California, Los Angeles activity score was 3.2 (2 to 8). Monobloc cementless stems reliably restore the anatomy in Perthes' disease at THA without the need for custom-made or modular implants. Cite this article: ",

        "abstract": "A limited prospective study was undertaken at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 Laval to assess the outcome of 21 isoelastic prostheses described by Butel. The femoral component consisted of a one-piece forged stainless steel stem with four metallic rods ranging in diameter from 11 to 18 mm, in 1 mm increments. The two lateral and medial rods, 20 cm in length, were linked distally. The 2 mm gap between the medial and lateral rods was obliterated at insertion, allowing the component to be firmly seated in the femoral canal. Twenty-one Butel isoelastic prostheses were inserted in 20 patients (14 men and 6 women with an average age of 51 years). The preoperative diagnosis was aseptic total hip prosthetic loosening in three cases, rheumatoid arthritis in five cases, avascular necrosis in six cases and degenerative arthritis in six cases. A standard postero-lateral approach was used in all cases. Postoperatively, the patients were mobilized immediately, with partial weight bearing on the affected side for six weeks. Follow-up ranged from 24 to 34 months with an average of 28 months. One patient, who developed a late infection, was excluded from the study. Nineteen patients with 20 prostheses were reviewed clinically and roentgenographically by independent observers in the absence of the senior author. Clinically, the patients rated 11 to 58 on the preoperative Harris scale with an average of 34 while they rated 39 to 96 postoperatively with an average of 67. Eight patients were below 70 on the Harris scale postoperatively and were rated unsatisfactory. Eleven patients complained of postoperative thigh pain which was still present in three patients after two years. None complained of pain related to the acetabular component. On roentgenograms, prosthetic seating seemed to be inadequate in 14 cases but with good clinical results in 9 cases. Seating seemed to be adequate in six cases but with an unsatisfactory outcome in three cases. The concept of isoelasticity is that the implant and bone should deform as one unit. However, clinical results of an implant must be validated by investigators who are not developers of their own implant. The results in this series do not corroborate with those reported by Butel. A number of technical problems occurring at or after surgery precluded the safety, efficacy and durability of the surgical procedure and its successful outcome. A substantial incidence of thigh pain was found in this series. This has also been noted by a variety of authors using femoral designs with a large intramedullary rod which has less torsional stability than a flat wedge shaped femoral implant. The isoelastic prosthesis used in this series did not fulfill the expectations and was considered marginal in regards to quality and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Recent projections suggest a substantial rise in demand for revision total hip arthroplasties, emphasizing the need for optimized perioperative care. Various revision techniques, such as isolated acetabular or femoral component revisions and total replacements, have garnered attention. Further research is needed to establish the most effective strategies for improving clinical outcomes. This retrospective analysis utilized data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Participant Use File from 2016 to 2021. The study aimed to compare clinical characteristics and 30-day outcomes among patients undergoing combined acetabular and femoral (A\u2009+\u2009F) revision, \u00a0acetabulum-only (A) revision, and femoral side-only (F) revision surgeries. The analysis of 18,888 patients revealed crucial differences in preoperative and postoperative outcomes among various revision strategies. Specifically, there were notable variations in patient demographics, comorbidities, and emergency procedures. Postoperative data showed distinct rates of mortality, complications, and readmissions across the groups. Notably, femoral component revisions were associated with increased risks of mortality, transfusion, and urinary tract infections, underscoring the need for careful evaluation and consideration when opting for this revision approach. The study's significance lies in its extensive patient cohort and multifaceted evaluation of revision strategies. Although consensus is lacking on single-component revisions, targeting the acetabulum component appears relatively safer. Continued research and individualized evaluations are crucial for refining revision strategies and optimizing outcomes in THA revisions.",

Hip arthroplasties with metal-on-metal articulations are also subject to the traditional methods of failure seen with different bearing couples. There is currently little information in the literature to help guide timely clinical evaluation and management of these patients. We therefore describe the (1) clinical presentations; (2) reasons for failure; (3) operative findings; and (4) histologic findings in patients with failed metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties. We retrospectively identified all 37 patients (37 hips) with metal on metal total hip or resurfacing arthroplasties who underwent revision over the past 3 years at our institution. Relevant clinical, radiographic, laboratory, intraoperative, and histopathologic findings were analyzed for all patients. Of the 37 patients, 10 were revised for presumed hypersensitivity specific to the metal-on-metal articulation. This group included eight patients with tissue histology confirming chronic inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, eight with aseptic loosening of a monoblock screwless uncemented acetabular component, two with iliopsoas impingement associated with a large-diameter femoral head, and three with femoral neck fracture after resurfacing arthroplasty; the remainder of the patients were revised for infection, instability, component malposition, and periprosthetic fracture. Increased awareness of the modes of failure will bring to light the potential complications particular to metal-on-metal articulations while placing these complications into the context of failures associated with all hip arthroplasties. This novel clinical information should be valuable for the practicing surgeon faced with this patient population. Level IV, therapeutic study.

The records of ninety-nine patients who had been managed with total hip arthroplasty with use of a cemented Charnley acetabular component and a cemented Charnley monoblock femoral component for the treatment of a femoral neck nonunion were retrospectively reviewed. The average age at the time of the arthroplasty was sixty-eight years. Eighty-four patients (85%) were followed until death, revision, or component removal or for at least two years (mean, 12.2 years) postoperatively. Twelve patients were treated with revision (eleven) or resection arthroplasty (one), eleven were lost to follow-up, and four died less than two years postoperatively. Of the remaining seventy-two unrevised hips that were followed for at least two years, sixty-nine (96%) had no or mild hip pain at the time of the last follow-up. The rate of component survival free of revision or removal for any reason was 93% at ten years and 76% at twenty years. The risk factors that were significantly associated with revision for aseptic loosening included an age of less than sixty-five years at the time of the arthroplasty (p = 0.045), a body-mass index of >/=30 (p < 0.01), and male gender (p = 0.02). The second most common complication after loosening was dislocation, which occurred in nine patients (9%). Total hip arthroplasty is an effective method for the treatment of nonunion of the femoral neck and provides satisfactory long-term results.

        "abstract": "To determine the evidence of effectiveness and safety for introduction of five recent and ostensibly high value implantable devices in major joint replacement to illustrate the need for change and inform guidance on evidence based introduction of new implants into healthcare. Systematic review of clinical trials, comparative observational studies, and registries for comparative effectiveness and safety of five implantable device innovations. PubMed (Medline), Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, CINAHL, reference lists of articles, annual reports of major registries, summaries of safety and effectiveness for pre-market application and mandated post-market studies at the US Food and Drug Administration. The five selected innovations comprised three in total hip replacement (ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, modular femoral necks, and uncemented monoblock cups) and two in total knee replacement (high flexion knee replacement and gender specific knee replacement). All clinical studies of primary total hip or knee replacement for symptomatic osteoarthritis in adults that compared at least one of the clinical outcomes of interest (patient centred outcomes or complications, or both) in the new implant group and control implant group were considered. Data searching, abstraction, and analysis were independently performed and confirmed by at least two authors. Quantitative data syntheses were performed when feasible. After assessment of 10,557 search hits, 118 studies (94 unique study cohorts) met the inclusion criteria and reported data related to 15,384 implants in 13,164 patients. Comparative evidence per device innovation varied from four low to moderate quality retrospective studies (modular femoral necks) to 56 studies of varying quality including seven high quality (randomised) studies (high flexion knee replacement). None of the five device innovations was found to improve functional or patient reported outcomes. National registries reported two to 12 year follow-up for revision occurrence related to more than 200,000 of these implants. Reported comparative data with well established alternative devices (over 1,200,000 implants) did not show improved device survival. Moreover, we found higher revision occurrence associated with modular femoral necks (hazard ratio 1.9) and ceramic-on-ceramic bearings (hazard ratio 1.0-1.6) in hip replacement and with high flexion knee implants (hazard ratio 1.0-1.8). We did not find convincing high quality evidence supporting the use of five substantial, well known, and already implemented device innovations in orthopaedics. Moreover, existing devices may be safer to use in total hip or knee replacement. Improved regulation and professional society oversight are necessary to prevent patients from being further exposed to these and future innovations introduced without proper evidence of improved clinical efficacy and safety.",

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of proximal femoral nailing (PFN) and a distally-fixed non-modular monoblock fluted long-stem hemiarthroplasty (HA) in elderly patients with an osteoporotic intertrochanteric fracture. This retrospective study included patients who had undergone surgery for an unstable intertrochanteric fracture. The patients were separated into PFN and HA groups. The demographic features of the 2 groups were compared. All patients were evaluated using the Singh index, ASA score, AO/OTA classification, Harris Hip Score (HHS), and Parker and Palmer mobility score. The most common complications were nonunion (12.0%) and cut-out of the screw (10.7%) in the PFN group, and dislocation of the prosthesis (6.7%) and wound infection (5.7%) in the HA group. Overall, the 2-year mortality rate was 29.3%. Mortality, particularly within the first 3\u2009months, was 2.4 times higher in the PFN Group than in the HA group (40% vs. 19.75%). Although the HHS was significantly higher in the first year for the HA group, no significant difference was seen between the 2 groups at 24\u2009months. Although PFN and HA have similar good outcomes at 2\u2009years, HA allows earlier mobilisation and has fewer complications and a lower mortality rate.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the survival of this implant, monitoring patients for at least 5 years in all consecutive cases operated in our centre. Between February 2006 and December 2008, our department performed 189 consecutive nonselected primary total hip arthroplasties using the RM\u00ae Pressfit cup, and all of these were included in the study. The operative technique involved an anterolateral approach. The latest follow-up evaluation was performed at a minimum of 5 years after the index arthroplasty. The mean follow-up was 6.5 years (5-8 years). We had preoperative information for 186 of the 189 patients. 102 patients were seen in consultation (54.0%), 46 (24.3%) patients were contacted by phone, 37 (19.6%) patients died, and 4 patients (2.1%) were lost for unknown reasons. Of the 189 arthroplasties, 6 (3.2%) required revision; 4 (2.1%) for infection, 1 (0.5%) for significant haematoma with persistent deglobulisation and 1 (0.5%) for periprosthetic calcification during the 5 to 8 years following the operation. No hip was revised because of aseptic loosening. The mean annual wear rate based on the last follow-up at 5 years minimum was 0.065 mm per year. We observed no migration, 1 femoral loosening and no acetabular loosening. Our study finds a good survival rate which is compatible with the 94% at 20 years with RM Classic\u00ae.

While dual-mobility (DM) bearings have been shown to mitigate this risk, options are limited when retaining or implanting an uncemented shell without modular DM options. In these circumstances, a monoblock DM cup, designed for cementing, can be cemented into an uncemented acetabular shell. The goal of this study was to describe the implant survival, complications, and radiological outcomes of this construct. We identified 64 patients (65 hips) who had a single-design cemented DM cup cemented into an uncemented acetabular shell during revision THA between 2018 and 2020 at our institution. Cups were cemented into either uncemented cups designed for liner cementing (n = 48; 74%) or retained (n = 17; 26%) acetabular components. Median outer head diameter was 42 mm. Mean age was 69 years (SD 11), mean BMI was 32 kg/m There were nine cemented DM cup revisions: three for periprosthetic joint infection, three for acetabular aseptic loosening from bone, two for dislocation, and one for a broken cup-cage construct. The two-year survivals free of aseptic DM revision and dislocation were both 92%. There were five postoperative dislocations, all in patients with prior dislocation or abductor deficiency. On radiological review, the DM cup remained well-fixed at the cemented interface in all but one case. While dislocation was not eliminated in this series of complex revision THAs, this technique allowed for maximization of femoral head diameter and optimization of effective acetabular component position during cementing. Of note, there was only one failure at the cemented interface.",

This paper presents a multicenter prospective cohort study that reports on outcomes from use of a Vitamin E-infused highly cross-linked polyethylene acetabular cup. Patients were recruited across nine medical institutions. Clinical outcome measures recorded were the Harris Hip Score, visual analogue score for pain and satisfaction. Evidence of implant loosening or osteolysis was collected radiologically. Cup survival and reasons for revision in relevant cases were also recorded. Data collection was undertaken preoperatively, at 6-12 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years. A total of 675 patients were recruited, with 450 cases available at final review. Data regarding cup survival was available to 8 years and 9 months postoperatively. Improvements in both the Harris Hip Score and visual analogue score for pain and satisfaction were recorded at all time points, with these being maintained through the length of follow-up. In total, 89% of cups were implanted within the Lewinnek safe zone. A lucent line was identified in one case, with no evidence of acetabular osteolysis observed throughout the follow-up period. Cup survival was 98.9% at 8 years and 9 months. No revisions for aseptic loosening were observed.

The Robert Mathys (RM) pressfit cup, an uncemented monoblock implant is expected to preserve bone density due to its composition and external surface, while reducing backside wear with its monoblock construction. These factors should lead to a high survival rate of the implant. To evaluate the mid-term survival and functional outcome of the RM Pressfit cup in a large study population. Between 2011 and 2020, we included 1324 patients receiving a primary THA using the RM pressfit cup. Final clinical follow-up was performed at 2 years postoperatively with the Dutch arthroplasty register used to assess implant status thereafter. Revision for acetabular failure and reason for revision were reported to evaluate implant survival, while the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) scores were used to assess functional outcome. The mean age at surgery was 64.9 years. The mean follow-up was 4.6 years. Of the 1324 THAs performed, 13 needed cup revisions within 5 years after index THA: 5 due to aseptic loosening, 6 due to infection, 2 due to dislocation and 2 due to other causes. This resulted in a 5-year cup survival of 98.8% (95%CI: 98.1-99.5). Nine of the cup revisions occurred within the first year after index THA. HOOS scores increased significantly in all domains during the first year and levelled out during the second year. In the present study, the RM pressfit cup demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes at mid-term follow-up; however, future studies are needed to assess the long-term outcomes of this acetabular implant.",

However, the degree to which they achieve this goal is not well documented. The purpose of this study was to use a systematic review of controlled trials to test the hypothesis that monoblock cups have superior (1) polyethylene wear rate; (2) frequency of cup migration; (3) frequency of acetabular osteolysis; and (4) frequency of aseptic loosening compared with modular components used in uncemented THA. A systematic search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane electronic databases to assemble all controlled trials comparing monoblock with modular uncemented acetabular components in primary THA. Included studies were considered \"best evidence\" if the quality score was either \u2265 50% on the Cochrane Back Review Group checklist or \u2265 75% the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. A total of seven publications met our inclusion criteria. Best evidence analysis showed no difference in polyethylene wear rate, the frequency of cup migration, and aseptic loosening between monoblock and modular acetabular components. No convincing evidence was found for the claim that lower frequencies of acetabular osteolysis are observed with the use of monoblock cups compared with modular uncemented cups. The purported benefits of monoblock cups were not substantiated by this systematic review of controlled studies in that polyethylene wear rates and frequencies of cup failure and acetabular osteolysis were similar to those observed with modular implants. Other factors should therefore drive implant selection in cementless THA.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to study the initial fixation and migration pattern of a monoblock acetabular component used for a metal on metal hip resurfacing using Einzel Bild Roentgen Analyse (EBRA). 99 patients with a mean age of 49.6 years (range 28.5-66.3 years) of whom 14 were bilateral underwent a hip resurfacing (Conserve Plus\u00ae, MicroPort, Memphis, TN) for a total of 113 resurfacings. Acetabular component orientation was noted with 35 of the 113 components (31.0%) having a lucency &gt;2 mm on the immediate postoperative radiograph. The mean follow-up for our cohort of 113 hips is 50 months (2-79 months). When examining the 2-year migration mark, 37 of the 113 hips exceeded the threshold of 0.5 mm/year with a median total migration of 1.40 mm (range 1.02-4.24). 6 resurfacings underwent revision surgery for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component at a mean time of 43.6 months. Presence of initial lucency (OR 2.29, p = 0.05) was the only significant predictor of migration over threshold at 2-years. Those that had migrated over the threshold (1.0 mm) at 2 years were at significantly greater risk of continued migration at 4 years. The migration pattern of this component raises concerns about long term performance, with postoperative lucencies representing a significant factor for future migration.",

        "abstract": "Acetabular component loosening is a leading cause for revision after metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty (MMHRA). We aimed to identify potential risk factors and determine radiographic signs associated with this mode of failure. From a series of 1375 hips treated with MMHRA, 21 (20 patients) underwent revision surgery secondary to aseptic loosening of the acetabular component and 6 patients had a radiographically loose acetabular component. A control group of 27 hips (26 patients) was selected among the patients that did not have a revision, and was matched for age, gender, component size and diagnosis. Mean time to revision in the loosening group was 103.0 months and the mean time of follow-up in the control group was 161.4 months. We found greater activity levels, range of motion scores, and cup abduction angles in the loosening group. The centre-edge (CE) angle of Wiberg was 10\u00b0 lower in the loosening group compared with the control group. In addition, 11 of the hips from the study group presented a sclerotic halo superior to the cup on the last radiograph vs. none in the control group. There was no difference in the prevalence of postoperative reaming gaps or radiographic signs of neck-cup impingement between the 2 groups. Risk factors for acetabular loosening included hip dysplasia with low CE angle, and a large cup abduction angle. The patient's level of activity influences the appearance of symptoms and the time to revision. We recommend selecting patients with a sufficient CE angle and properly orienting the cup.",

        "abstract": "We investigated patient characteristics and outcomes of Vancouver type B periprosthetic fractures treated with femoral component revision and/or osteosynthesis. The study utilized data from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register (SHAR) and information from patient records. We included all primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed in Sweden since 1979, and undergoing further surgery due to Vancouver type B periprosthetic femoral fracture between 2001 and 2011. The primary outcome measure was any further reoperation between 2001 and 2013. Cross-referencing with the National Patient Register was performed in two stages, in order to identify all surgical procedures not recorded on the SHAR. Out of 1381 Vancouver type B fractures that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 257 underwent further reoperation by the end of 2013. Interprosthetic and Type B1 fractures had a higher risk for reoperation. For B1 fractures, the rate of reoperation did not differ (p = 0.322) after use of conventional (26%) or locking plate osteosynthesis (19%). No significant differences were observed between cemented, cementless monoblock, and cementless modular revision components for the treatment of type B2 and B3 fractures. In this country-specific study, the choice of locking or conventional plates for the treatment of type B1, and cemented or cementless femoral components fixation for B2 and B3 fractures, had no significant influence on risk for reoperation. Interprosthetic fractures adversely affected the outcome of treatment of type B fractures. Differences in the patient characteristics of the compared groups were observed. Cite this article: ",

With increasing use and long-term follow up, certain complications particularly related to fretting, corrosion and fatigue have been recognized. A 31 year old active male patient presented with spontaneous dissociation of the Anatomic Medullary Locking A Plus (AML A Plus) Femoral Component at head and neck interface 10 years after surgery. At revision surgery, wear of the acetabular liner and head and neck taper was noted. Definitive treatment required complete revision of the femoral component and change of acetabular liner. While modularity allows change of worn out components, this case highlights the importance of various factors in avoiding this complication and the need for surgeon to be prepared to use 'taper sleeves' or revise the components if taper exchange fails particularly in cases with dissociation of head-neck interface which is usually associated with taper damage.",

        "abstract": "Surgeons currently have difficulty when managing metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty (MoMHA) patients with adverse reactions to metal debris (ARMD). This stems from a lack of evidence, which is emphasized by the variability in the recommendations proposed by different worldwide regulatory authorities for considering MoMHA revision surgery. We investigated predictors of poor outcomes following MoMHA revision surgery performed for ARMD to help inform the revision threshold and type of reconstruction. We retrospectively studied 346 MoMHA revisions for ARMD performed at 2 European centers. Preoperative (metal ions/imaging) and intraoperative (findings, components removed/implanted) factors were used to predict poor outcomes. Poor outcomes were postoperative complications (including re-revision), 90-day mortality, and poor Oxford Hip Score. Poor outcomes occurred in 38.5%. Shorter time (under 4 years) to revision surgery was the only preoperative predictor of poor outcomes (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0= 2.12, confidence interval [CI]\u00a0= 1.00-4.46). Prerevision metal ions and imaging did not influence outcomes. Single-component revisions (vs all-component revisions) increased the risk of poor outcomes (OR\u00a0= 2.99, CI\u00a0= 1.50-5.97). Intraoperative modifiable factors reducing the risk of poor outcomes included the posterior approach (OR\u00a0= 0.22, CI\u00a0= 0.10-0.49), revision head sizes \u226536 mm (vs <36 mm: OR\u00a0= 0.37, CI\u00a0= 0.18-0.77), ceramic-on-polyethylene revision bearings (OR vs ceramic-on-ceramic\u00a0= 0.30, CI\u00a0= 0.14-0.66), and metal-on-polyethylene revision bearings (OR vs ceramic-on-ceramic\u00a0= 0.37, CI\u00a0= 0.17-0.83). No threshold exists for recommending revision in MoMHA patients with ARMD. However postrevision outcomes were surgeon modifiable. Optimal outcomes may be achieved if surgeons use the posterior approach, revise all MoMHA components, and use \u226536 mm ceramic-on-polyethylene or metal-on-polyethylene articulations.",

This study reports the 20-year results of a monoblock press-fit acetabular component. A total of 122 total hip arthroplasties (111 patients) using the Morscher cup were reviewed at a mean of 19.7 years. The average age at implantation was 57.3 years (range, 36-74 years), and 81 (66%) were men. Twenty-two patients (25 hips) had died. Seven hips were revised, including 5 acetabular revisions. Six patients (6 hips) declined to participate but were known not to have been revised. The mean Oxford hip score was 41.1 (range, 22-48), and the mean reduced Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score was 5.7/48 (range, 0-24).

This has the potential to offer the advantages of an increased range of motion and enhanced joint stability. These features could benefit younger and high-demand patients in need of total hip arthroplasty.

Data from the AOANJRR were analyzed for all patients who had undergone a primary conventional THA performed between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2021. Only prostheses with ceramic/ceramic, ceramic/XLPE, metal/XLPE, or CM/XLPE bearing surfaces were included. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative percent revision for all causes. Secondary outcome measures were revision for dislocation/instability, ceramic breakage, or noise. A subanalysis for cup size was also performed. There were 486,946 primary conventional THA procedures undertaken for any reason. Of these, 4,033 used the DeltaMotion cup and 482,913 were modular designs. The DeltaMotion cup had the lowest CPR for all diagnoses compared to the modular bearings at all time points, had a significantly lower revision rate for prosthesis dislocation and no revisions for squeaking compared to other modular bearings. There were 175 ceramic breakages recorded in the modular bearing group and 1 ceramic breakage in the DeltaMotion group. The DeltaMotion cup had a low rate of all-cause revision, and for dislocation, ceramic breakage, and noise.

Clinical and radiological evaluation was performed at regular intervals for a mean of 10.2 years (8.5 to 12). The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 48.3 (15 to 65) pre-operatively to 89.5 (56 to 100) at the final follow-up. The mean Oxford Hip Score was 49.5 (35 to 59) pre-operatively and decreased to 21.2 (12 to 48) at one year and 15.2 (10 to 28) at final follow-up. Migration of the acetabular component was assessed with the EBRA software system. There was a mean migration of 0.68 mm (0.49 to 0.8) in the first year and a mean 0.89 mm (0.6 to 0.98) in the second year, after excluding one initial excessive migration. No revision was necessary for any reason, no acetabular component became loose, and no radiolucent lines were observed at the final follow-up. The porous tantalum monoblock acetabular component is an implant offering adequate initial stability in conjunction with a modulus of elasticity and porosity close to that of cancellous bone. It favours bone ingrowth, leading to good mid-term results.",

        "abstract": "Trabecular metal has shown promising results in experimental studies of bone ingrowth. Several clinical studies support these results. However, until now, no randomized clinical radiostereometric analysis (RSA) studies have been published. In this randomized RSA trial, we compared a new acetabular cup with a surface made of tantalum trabecular metal and a cup with a titanium fiber-mesh surface. Between 2004 and 2006, we operated 60 patients with noninflammatory hip arthritis. The patients were randomized to receive either an uncemented cup with a titanium fiber-mesh surface (Trilogy cup) or a cup with a trabecular tantalum surface (Monoblock cup). After 2 years, 50 patients had completed the study. The primary endpoint was cup migration within the first 2 years after surgery; the secondary endpoints were change in bone mineral density and Harris hip score at 3 months. Both cup types showed excellent fixation. RSA revealed minimal translation and rotation at 2 years. There was no statistically significant difference between the cup types with regard to translation. However, less rotation along the transverse axis was seen in the trabecular metal cups than in the fiber mesh cups: mean -0.01\u00ba (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.12) for trabecular metal cups and -0.60\u00ba (-0.72 to -0.48) for fiber-mesh cups (p = 0.04). The degree of periprosthetic bone loss was similar between the cup types in any of the regions of interest at 2 years of follow-up. 3 months postoperatively, we found a similar increase in Harris hip score in both groups: from around 50 to over 90. We found promising early results concerning fixation of trabecular metal components to the acetabular host bone. However, we recommend a longer observation period to evaluate the outcome of this new cup design.",

Between 1991 and 1995 a total of 630 RM cups were implanted in 462 patients. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed with failure defined as acetabular revision for any reason. The mean follow-up was 8.2 years. A total of 34 acetabular revisions (5%) were carried out: 15 for recurrent dislocation due to cup malposition, nine for wear caused by impingement of a loose femoral component, five for aseptic loosening, only one cup was revised for articular polyethylene wear, and four for other causes. The cumulative survival rate of the RM cup is 91% at 10.7 years, with a worst case scenario of 87%. The cumulative survival rate for aseptic loosening was calculated: 99% at 10.7 years. The titanium-coated RM cup shows an impressive survival rate with revision for aseptic loosening as endpoint.

The underlying diagnosis that led to the primary THA was primary osteoarthritis in 43 hips, avascular necrosis in 4, developmental hip dysplasia in 3, rheumatoid arthritis in 3 and post-traumatic osteoarthritis in\u00a01. One cup was revised for deep infection; at surgery, the cup showed osseointegration. At a mean follow-up of 15.6 years (range, 15-16 years), the survivorship with cup revision for aseptic loosening as end point was 100%. There was no radiographic evidence of loosening, migration, or gross polyethylene wear at last follow-up. The mean Harris Hip Scores improved from 47 points preoperatively to 94 points.

In order to increase range of movement (ROM) and decrease dislocation rates, some manufacturers have introduced larger diameter head (LDH) CoC bearings. This has been achieved with the use of preassembled cup designs, in which the ceramic liner is already fitted into the metal backing and implanted as a monoblock component by the surgeon. In this report we present data from a series of 5 patients with ceramic liner dissociation from a monoblock cup. All cases were overweight men with acetabular components of 56 or 58 mm. After a mean of 5.5 (range, 3.5-6.7) years, all patients reported sudden pain and audible noise when performing activities of daily living. Liner displacement was suspected on plain radiographs and confirmed by Ct-scan. Pneumarthrosis was present in all cases. Taper modular junction wear and corrosion signs were observed in the four revised patients. Although one of our case is still treated conservatively, implant revision is probably inevitable. Further LDH CoC implant design should take in consideration this potential complication by avoiding bearing diameters over 40mm and/or improving locking mechanism or by providing a real monoblock acetabular implant.",

We prospectively followed 223 consecutive patients with 245 trabecular metal acetabular cups implanted during primary total hip arthroplasties to determine the overall survivorship of the implant, and any association of survivorship to primary diagnosis and age, and to determine the fate of polar gaps and cysts. Minimum followup was 36 months (mean, 60 months; range, 36-112 months). Patients were assessed with the Harris Hip score and the Oxford questionnaire and radiographically with standardized serial radiographs. At last followup, all cups were radiographically stable with no evidence of migration or progressive radiolucencies. The survivorship with reoperation as the end point was estimated at 98.75% with a 95% confidence interval. Three reoperations occurred during the first 36 months. The Harris hip score increased from 48 to 94 and the Oxford score was 16.4 at the last examination. We observed no difference in terms of survivorship among patients with osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis, or hip dysplasia. Seven of 14 (50%) osteoarthritis cysts and 10 of 33 (33.3%) polar gaps detected on postoperative radiographs decreased or filled, whereas none of the remainder deteriorated with time.

Austin-Moore(\u00ae) prostheses lead to more re-operations (6.7%) compared to modular implants (3.5%) and Thompson(\u00ae)/ETS(\u00ae) (2.4%). A Cox regression analysis, adjusting for other risk factors, shows twice the risk of re-operation for Austin-Moore(\u00ae) implants (CI 1.5-2.8), in particular, due to periprosthetic fracture (5.4; CI 3.2-9.1) and dislocation (1.9; CI 1.3-3.0). The Thompson(\u00ae)/ETS(\u00ae) implants do not influence the overall risk of re-operation (0.7; CI 0.5-1.2) compared to modular implants and decrease the risk of re-operation due to infection (0.2;CI 0.04-0.7). An increased risk of re-operation is also seen in men, age groups 75-85 years and <75 years and after secondary fracture surgery. Both Swedish and Australian orthopaedic surgeons have decreased their use of Austin-Moore(\u00ae) implants after reports from their national arthroplasty registers identifying inferior outcome for this implant. Due to the increased risk of re-operations, it should not be used in modern orthopaedic care. Cemented Thompson(\u00ae) or ETS(\u00ae) implants could still be suitable for the oldest, low-activity patients.

This retrospective analysis consisted of 4,043 cementless hip devices (3,209 THAs and 834 HRAs). We identified 41 patients with early aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. A control group of 123 patients without acetabular component loosening was randomly selected. The demographic data and risk factors for loosening of the acetabular component were evaluated. The mean follow-up time was 4.6 years (range, 1.7-7.8). The end-point was acetabular revision. The incidence of early acetabular component loosening was 1.0\u00a0%. Mean time to revision was 1.2 years (SD 1.6, range 0.0-5.4). There was significantly more Dorr type A and C acetabular morphology in patients with early loosening (P\u2009=\u20090.014). The loosened components were implanted to more vertical (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and less anteverted (P\u2009=\u20090.001) position than those of the control group. Presence of acetabular dysplasia or acetabular component type did not associate to early loosening. Acetabular morphology (Dorr type A and C) and component positioning vertically and less anteverted were more common in patients with early aseptic loosening of cementless acetabular components. Suboptimal cup position most likely reflects challenges to obtain sufficient stability during surgery.

At follow-up, complete shell-to-bone contact without a radiolucent line was observed in 26 (67%) of the modular devices and in 37 (93%) of monoblock (P < .001). The modular device was an independent predictor of radiolucent lines (odds ratio 19.1, P\u00a0= .007). No cases underwent revision surgery for acetabular loosening. Both the porous-coated modular and hydroxyapatite-coated monoblock acetabular components showed successful clinical results at short-term follow-up with no difference in pixel-level BMD. Using a large head monoblock device does not appear to be associated with an adverse effect on the local bone environment when compared to a modular device. NCT: NCT01558752.",

        "abstract": "The intraoperative occurrence of an acetabular fracture is a rare complication of primary total hip arthroplasty. Previous reports have lacked a sufficiently large number of subjects to allow for an analysis of the causes and appropriate treatment of this problem. Between 1990 and 2000, 7121 primary total hip arthroplasties were performed at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed the records in our Total Joint Registry and found that twenty-one patients (twenty-one hips) had sustained an intraoperative acetabular fracture. Nineteen of these patients (nineteen hips) had been followed until revision or for a minimum of two years (mean duration of follow-up, forty-four months). We evaluated the anatomic location, cause, treatment, and outcome of the fractures. Acetabular component designs were categorized as modular, nonmodular (monoblock), true hemispherical, or elliptical, and then each design was analyzed for fracture risk. No fractures occurred in association with cemented acetabular components. The fracture rate associated with uncemented components was 0.4%. In seventeen hips, the acetabular component was judged to be stable despite the detection of a fracture and the cup was retained. In four hips, the original cup was not stable and therefore was replaced with a design that allowed for supplemental screw fixation. All fractures united, and all cups demonstrated osseous ingrowth at the time of the most recent follow-up. Elliptical monoblock cups were associated with a significantly higher fracture rate than were elliptical modular cups (p < 0.0001) and hemispherical modular cups (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between elliptical modular and hemispherical modular components with regard to the fracture rate. Acetabular fracture during primary total hip arthroplasty is a rare complication of acetabular fixation without cement. In the present series, retention of a stable cup was associated with uneventful osseous ingrowth and excellent early-term outcomes. We found a high rate of fracture in association with the use of monoblock elliptical components. Therapeutic Level III.",

        "abstract": "Aseptic loosening, caused by wear and osteolysis, is the most frequent reason for hip replacement revision in the UK. To prevent aseptic loosening, an acetabular component with vitamin E added to irradiated highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) was developed to reduce oxidative degradation. A prior study of the vitamin E-blended HXLPE acetabular component after 2\u00a0years of follow-up reported no adverse reactions or abnormal mechanical behavior. To further examine this hypothesis of reducing wear and osteolysis, we sought to evaluate outcomes after 6-year follow-up. A cohort of 95 of the 112 initial patients (84.2%) completed the 6\u00a0years of follow-up after receiving a vitamin E-blended HXLPE acetabular component. Evaluation was performed in terms of clinical (visual analog scale [VAS] score, VAS score with weight-bearing, VAS score for satisfaction, and Harris Hip Score) and radiological (inclination, polar gap, radiolucencies, migration, and 2-D linear femoral head penetration rate) assessment. The mean VAS score for patient satisfaction was 8.75 and the mean Harris Hip Score was 91.8. There were two revisions because of deep infections and one because of a peri-prosthetic femoral fracture. Two acetabular components migrated initially; however, delayed acetabular stabilization occurred. Both patients had good clinical scores at 72\u00a0months. The mean femoral head penetration rate was 0.036\u00a0mm/year. This prospective cohort study has shown no adverse reactions concerning the vitamin E additive, promising wear rates, no signs of osteolysis, a 100% survival rate for aseptic loosening, and an all-cause survivorship percentage of 97.4% at 6\u00a0years of follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Limited implant survival due to aseptic cup loosening is most commonly responsible for revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). Advances in implant designs and materials have been crucial in addressing those challenges. Vitamin E-infused highly cross-linked polyethylene (VEPE) promises strong wear resistance, high oxidative stability, and superior mechanical strength. Although VEPE monoblock cups have shown good mid-term performance and excellent wear patterns, long-term results remain unclear. This study evaluated migration and wear patterns and clinical and radiological outcomes at a minimum of ten years' follow-up. This prospective observational study investigated 101 cases of primary THA over a mean duration of 129 months (120 to 149). At last follow-up, 57 cases with complete clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated. In all cases, the acetabular component comprised an uncemented titanium particle-coated VEPE monoblock cup. Patients were assessed clinically and radiologically using the Harris Hip Score, visual analogue scale (pain and satisfaction), and an anteroposterior radiograph. Cup migration and polyethylene wear were measured using Einzel-Bild-R\u00f6ntgen-Analyze software. All complications and associated treatments were documented until final follow-up. Clinical assessment showed persistent major improvement in all scores. On radiological assessment, only one case showed a lucent line (without symptoms). At last follow-up, wear and migration were below the critical thresholds. No cup-related revisions were needed, indicating an outstanding survival rate of 100%. Isoelastic VEPE cups offer high success rates and may prevent osteolysis, aseptic loosening, and the need for revision surgeries in the long term. However, longer follow-up is needed to validate our findings and confirm the advantages offered by this cup.",

        "abstract": "Osteolysis associated with acetabular component loosening can produce significant acetabular defects. The combined (segmental and cavitary) or type III defect can present a very challenging reconstructive problem. Several methods of reconstruction for type III defects have been described, including the use of oblong or eccentric sockets. These implants are attractive, theoretically, because they allow restoration of the hip center without use of structural bone graft. The results of this method however have not been widely reported. From a series of type III defects reconstructed from 1987 to 1991, six hips were reconstructed with eccentric acetabular components, provided by three different manufacturers. Four of these six implants were custom and two were off-the-shelf. At 4-years minimum follow-up, three of the six sockets had failed and had been revised. All three failures had been custom implants produced by the same manufacturer. The other three sockets had produced good clinical results. The features common to the failed implants were: (1) custom manufacture; (2) small ingrowth pads not integral with the body of the implant; and (3) lack of specific instrumentation (reamers) for insertion of the implant. Eccentric sockets may have limited, although well-defined, indications for use, such as acetabular revision needed in the presence of a well-fixed or monolithic femoral stem. Early experience suggests that custom eccentric acetabular components are not well suited for such indications.",

Revisions were done with larger diameter cementless acetabular components replacing one-piece Porous Coated Anatomic devices for which no replacement liner was available. The objective was to determine the increase in size of the revision acetabular component and to assess clinical and radiographic outcomes. The Porous Coated Anatomic components were in place for an average of 7.8 years. At an average followup of 68 months, all revision components remain in place. Preoperatively, 12 hips in 10 patients had radiographic osteolysis, and 25 osteolytic lesions in 17 patients were grafted at revision. All grafted lesions showed partial or complete evidence of bone graft consolidation. The average revision component size increased 8.5 mm in diameter (range, 3-14 mm) compared with the primary component size. This corresponded to an average 6.5-mm increase in the acetabular cavitary diameter. When locking mechanism failure in a well-fixed cementless acetabular component prevents polyethylene liner replacement, acetabular component revision can provide good clinical and radiographic results with acceptable bone loss and improved access to osteolytic areas for debridement and grafting.",

The secondary outcome was to measure patient-reported clinical function. A total of 50 patients (25 per group) were randomised to MoM or metal-on-polyethlene (MoP). There were 27 women (11 MoM) and 23 men (14 MoM) with a mean age of 61.6\u00a0years (47.7 to 73.2).

The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score, Harris hip score, and RAND-36 were also completed at these intervals. At two years, only zone 1 showed a loss in BMD (-2.5%) in MoM group compared with a gain in the MoP group (+2.2%). Zone 2 showed loss in both groups (-2.2% for MoM; -3.9% for MoP) and zones 3 and 4 a gain in both groups (+0.1% for MoM; +3.3% for MoP). No other between-group differences were detected. When adjusting for BMD of the contralateral hip, no differences in BMD were observed. The only significant differences in functional scores at two years were higher UCLA activity (7.3 (sd 1.2) vs 6.1 (sd 1.5); p = 0.01) and RAND-36 physical function (82.1 (sd 13.0) vs 64.5 (sd 26.4); p = 0.02) for MoM bearings versus MoP. One revision was performed in the MoM group, for aseptic acetabular loosening at 11\u00a0months. When controlling for systemic BMD, there were no significant differences between MoM and MoP groups in peri-acetabular BMD.

It's purported advantages over modular cemented cups are: (1) its modulus of elasticity approximating bone, thus mimicking load transmission and the biomechanical behaviour of the cup to better match stresses on the acetabulum, leading to bone-preservation; and (2) as a 1-piece cup there is absence of a mobile interface between a liner and shell, preventing backside wear. Since its inception in 1983 there have been 3 major design changes: the RM Classic, the RM Pressfit, and the RM Vitamys with the most modern polyethylene (vitamin E). In a retrospective cohort study of the New Zealand Joint Registry, all designs of RM acetabular cup were reviewed. Data were included from1998 to 2018. All-cause revision rates, reasons for revision and the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) were assessed. In total 13,272 acetabular cups were included. The all-cause revision rates did not differ between the designs. Revision rates for aseptic loosening in the RM Vitamys were lower, but the follow-up was shorter and more larger heads were used. There was no difference in the OHS. All implant designs were safe. The use of larger heads led to a decrease in revisions due to dislocation. It has to be waited out whether the RM Vitamys performs superior in the long-term due to the highly cross-linked polyethylene.",

During 2006-2008, we performed a randomized controlled trial on 37 patients (mean age 63 years (SD 7), 22 females) in whom we implanted a cementless press-fit socket. The socket was implanted with additional screw fixation (group A, n = 19) and without additional screw fixation (group B, n = 18). Using radiostereometric analysis with a 2-year follow-up, we determined the stability of the socket. Clinically relevant migration was defined as > 1 mm translation and > 2\u00ba rotation. Clinical scores were determined. The sockets without screw fixation showed a statistically significantly higher proximal translation compared to the socket with additional screw fixation. However, this higher migration was below the clinically relevant threshold. The numbers of migratory sockets were not significantly different between groups. After the 2-year follow-up, there were no clinically relevant differences between groups A and B regarding the clinical scores. 1 patient dropped out of the study.

Two hundred and forty-two patients underwent THA revision at Orthopaedic Clinic of Pisa and Versilia (ITA) from January 2007 to December 2016. We have systematically excluded revisions due to septic or traumatic prosthesis loosening, revisions of both implant components (cotyle and stem) and replacement alone. To evaluate implant stability, we used preoperative X ray and intra-operative mechanical stress tests, applying accredited criteria. Two hundred and twenty-six patients (93%) underwent a single procedure of THA revision: 193 had cotyle replacement and 33 had femoral stem replacement. The remaining 16 (7 %) underwent at least two procedures: 10 of them had consecutive failure of the same component, while the other 6 had revision of the other component after the first procedure. Considering our cases series, we can assert that single component revision is the best choice when no signs of loosening are present on the remaining component.

In this article, we report three cases of revision surgeries for broken, cementless, and extensively porous-coated femoral stems with Solution stems (DePuy, Warsaw, Indiana). In all cases, minimally invasive endofemoral revision was successfully performed without femoral osteotomy or cortical fenestration. Removal of distal broken femoral stem was performed with hollow trephine technique under fluoroscopy. For revision arthroplasty of the femoral component, Solution stems of larger diameter were used. Endofemoral approach reduces duration of surgery and the amount of blood and bone loss. Minimally invasive technique for broken and uncemented femoral stem is recommended.",

A total of 146 patients were randomized to a DM (n\u00a0= 76; 46 mm median effective head size, range 36 to 59 mm) or a large femoral head (n\u00a0= 70; twenty-five 36 mm heads [35.7%], forty-one 40 mm heads [58.6%], and four 44 mm heads [5.7%]). There were 71 single-component revisions (48.6%), 39 both-component revisions (26.7%), 24 reimplantations of THA after 2-stage revision (16.4%), seven isolated head and liner exchanges (4.8%), four conversions of hemiarthroplasty (2.7%), and 1 revision of a hip resurfacing (0.7%). Power analysis determined that 161 patients were required in each group to lower the dislocation rate from 8.4 to 2.2% (power\u00a0= 0.8, alpha\u00a0= 0.05). At a mean of 18.2 months (range, 1.4 to 48.2), there were three dislocations in the large femoral head group compared to two in the DM cohort (4.3 versus 2.6%; P\u00a0= .67). One patient in the large head group and none in the DM group were successfully treated with closed reduction without subsequent revision. Interim analysis of this randomized controlled trial found no difference in the risk of dislocation between DM and large femoral heads in revision THA, although the rate of dislocation was lower than anticipated and continued follow-up is needed.",

We identified patients who received THA for ONFH from January 2007 to December 2018 using ICD diagnosis codes and procedural codes. Patients were categorized into two groups according to the fixation method: with or without cement. The survivorship of THA was calculated using the following end points: revision of both the cup and stem, revision of the single component, any type of revision, PJI, and PPF. A total of 40,606 patients: 3,738 patients (9.2%) with cement and 36,868 patients (90.7%) without cement, received THA for ONFH. The mean age of the noncemented fixation group (56.2 \u00b1 13.2 years) was significantly lower than that of the cemented fixation group (57.0 \u00b1 15.7 years, P = 0.003). The risk of revision and PJI was notably higher in cemented THA (hazard ratio: 1.44 [1.21 to 1.72] and 1.66 [1.36 to 2.04], respectively). Noncemented THA had a higher 12-year survivorship compared with cemented THA with any revision and PJI as the end point.

The standard type is fixed without cement. Most of the hip movements take place between the metal and the polyethylene cup. 104 Monk arthroplasties were performed. 95 hips in 84 patients have been available for regular examination and follow-up. The follow-up period was from 12 to 30 months, an average of 19 months. Out of the 95 cases, 72 were classified as excellent, 10 as good and 13 as unchanged. The results obtained during the first year were comparable to those obtained with the Ring prosthesis, but during the following 1 1/2 years eight revisions had to be performed. The main reason for the deterioration was loosening of the femoral component, probably because in the standard type it is too short and the neck has too great a varus inclination, resulting in a rather strong tilting force. Because no cement has been used the revisions have been quite easy to perform. Another reason for failure has been wear of the polyethylene cup, in one case with a massive foreign body reaction. In spite of a short follow-up period this report illustrates the failures due to the design of the prosthesis, and therefore an improved construction is now in use.",

The average age of the patients at the time of the arthroplasty was sixty-one years (range, twenty-one to eighty-five years). Sixty-seven patients (seventy-seven hips) died less than seventeen years after the index operation. The remaining seventy-three patients (eighty-four hips) were followed for an average of eighteen years (range, seventeen to twenty years). No patient was lost to follow-up. In the entire group of 161 hips, over the twenty-year span of the study, eight femoral components (5 percent) and twenty-eight acetabular components (17 percent) had been revised because of aseptic loosening. Of the seventy-seven hips in the sixty-seven patients who died, four had been revised because of aseptic loosening of the acetabular component only; one, because of aseptic loosening of the femoral component only; and one, because of aseptic loosening of both components. Of the eighty-four hips in the seventy-three patients who were alive at least seventeen years after the index arthroplasty, twenty-four hips (29 percent) in twenty-one patients had had revision of one or both components for any reason. Twenty-three acetabular components (27 percent) and six femoral components (7 percent) had been revised because of aseptic loosening. An additional two hips (2 percent) in two patients were loose according to radiographic criteria but had not been revised. Of the sixty-five all-polyethylene acetabular components that had been inserted with cement and were in patients who were alive at least seventeen years postoperatively, fifteen (23 percent) had been revised because of aseptic loosening. An additional seventeen cups (26 percent) were loose according to radiographic criteria. Thus, a total of thirty-two cups (49 percent) had been revised because of loosening or were loose but had not been revised at the time of the latest follow-up. The femoral components that had been inserted with use of second-generation cementing techniques fared better than did the acetabular components that had been inserted with these techniques during the same time-period. We found that assessment of all postoperative radiographs rather than only those that had been made immediately postoperatively increased the accuracy of the grading of the cement around the femoral component. Subsequent radiographs frequently had been made at different projections, which revealed new findings, consisting primarily of previously undetected voids, areas of thin cement, and defects in the cement mantle. Thus, we now use all available radiographs to determine the grade of the cement.",

Cobalt and chromium serum levels were measured one\u00a0year after surgery in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty with a DM construct. Ion levels were detected above 1 \u03bcg/L. Clinical and surgical data were correlated with the ion levels for analysis. Overall, 29% of the patients had levels above 1 \u03bcg/L of either ion. More patients with modular cups had detectable ions than patients with monoblock cups (39% vs 20%,  We found similar cobalt and chromium levels in patients with monoblock and modular DM cups.

        "abstract": "Background and purpose - The long-term survival of arthroplasty components may be limited by polyethylene wear-related problems such as periprosthetic osteolysis and aseptic loosening. Highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) blended with vitamin E was introduced to improve oxidative stability and to avoid long-term embrittlement. This study clinically compares the tribological behavior and clinical outcome of vitamin E blended HXLPE with ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) in an isoelastic monoblock cup for uncemented total hip arthroplasty.Patients and methods - In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), 199 patients were included: 102 patients received the vitamin E blended HXLPE cup, 97 patients the UHMWPE cup. Clinical and radiographic parameters were obtained preoperatively, directly postoperative and at 3, 12, and 24 months. Wear rates were compared using the mean linear femoral head penetration (FHP) rate.Results - 188 patients (94%) completed the 2-year follow-up. Mean patient satisfaction was higher in the vitamin E blended HXLPE group (8.9 [1]) than in in the control group (8.5 [2], p = 0.03). The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was higher in the vitamin E blended HXLPE group (95 [8]) than in the control group (92 [11], p = 0.3). The FHP rate was lower in the vitamin E blended HXLPE group: 0.046\u2009mm/year compared with 0.056\u2009mm/year in the control group (p = 0.05). No adverse reactions associated with the clinical application of vitamin E blended HXLPE were observed during follow-up, with an excellent 2-year survival to revision rate of 98% for both cups.Interpretation - This study shows the superior performance of the HXLPE blended with vitamin E acetabular cup with lower linear femoral head penetration rates and better clinical results compared with the UHMWPE acetabular cup after 2 years.",

        "abstract": "Uncemented acetabular components have demonstrated low revision rates and high patient satisfaction but with concerns regarding increased costs compared with monoblock cups. Some newer lower-cost uncemented monoblock options have become available in the last decade, but limited data are available on their performance. (1) Does an uncemented, titanium-backed all-polyethylene acetabular cup provide reliable fixation? (2) What is the frequency and what are the causes for revision with this cup? Between 2004 and 2008, we elected to use an uncemented, titanium-backed all-polyethylene acetabular cup in older patients with limited physical demands. We performed 615 hip replacements in 550 patients with greater than 5 years of clinical and radiographic followup. When patients who were dead (80 hips in 75 patients), lost to followup (98 hips in 93 patients), or revised (three hips in three patients) were excluded, there were 434 hips in 379 patients for comparison of the postoperative and 5-year radiographs. Two observers not involved in the index surgical procedures (NH, HS) assessed radiographs for signs of migration or loosening. Some degree of early movement sometimes is seen before cup stabilization; however, to be conservative, we defined cups with greater than 3\u00b0 of change of position (even if they subsequently stabilized) as potentially at risk and report them separately. Revision surgery, time from the index procedure, and the reason for revision were recorded from the New Zealand Joint Registry. By 5 years there was a median change in inclination of 2\u00b0 (range, 0\u00b0-13\u00b0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-2.4; p < 0.001) and 2\u00b0 of anteversion (range, 0\u00b0-11\u00b0; 95% CI, 2.0-2.4; p < 0.001). Although at last followup all cups appeared to have stabilized with no radiolucent lines or medial migration, 22% of the cups (94 of 434) had moved more than 3\u00b0 and so were deemed to be potentially at risk. There were 11 revision procedures (of 429 hips; 2.5%) of which six were for recurrent dislocation, four for femoral fracture, and one for femoral loosening to give an overall all-cause revision rate for all components of 0.25 per 100 component years (95% CI, 0.13-0.43). No revisions were performed for acetabular loosening. The short- to medium-term results of this all-polyethylene monoblock cup demonstrated a low frequency of revision. However, 94 cups were identified as potentially at risk based on movement of > 3\u00b0 before apparent stabilization. Although those patients seem to be doing well enough now, the current duration of followup may not be sufficient to know that these cups will be durable, because other ongrowth designs have demonstrated a high frequency of late failure after apparent early success.

        "abstract": "Periprosthetic femoral fracture around hip arthroplasty are growing in the world, nevertheless management and treatment options for fractures \"around the stem\" are still debated due to lack of high-level studies. A 85-item survey were fill out by 40 Italian Orthopedic Surgeon member of SIOT (Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Ortopedia e Traumatologia) and AIR (Associazione Italiana Riprotesizzazione) to assess their current opinion in the management of type B periprosthetic femoral fractures. Responses were summarized using proportions, and further stratified by practice type, case volume, surgeon age, and fellowship training. Vancouver/UCS fracture classification showed a good interobserver agreement (k value = .76). ORIF were the treatment of choice for UCS type B1 fractures (100%), revision stem for B2 (85%) and B3 (100%). Locked plates were preferred to cable plate and cerclage without a plate for B1 fractures (50% vs 40% vs 10%); revision with modular stem was preferred to monoblock stem for B2 fractures (50% vs 35%) and B3 (75% vs 15%). Responders tended to postpone at 1-month weight-bearing in patients with B1 fractures. Regarding postoperative pharmacological treatment there was absolute lack of consensus. The primary finding of our survey confirmed the preference of ORIF for B1 fractures and stem revision for B2 and B3 fractures. However, there is no definitive operative technique for all UCS B fractures. Surgeons tended to favor locked plating over cable plating, although only slightly. This general lack of consensus coincides with the inconclusive evidence that currently exists in the literature, which demonstrates both favorable and unfavorable outcomes for both techniques. The absence of complete homogeneity among participants showed the need for prospective randomized studies to set up stronger guidelines for classification, management, surgical treatment, rehabilitation, and pharmacological support of periprosthetic femoral fractures.",

        "abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) continues to be one of the most successful surgical procedures in the medical field. However, over the last two decades, the use of modularity and alternative bearings in THA has become routine. Given the known problems associated with hard-on-hard bearing couples, including taper failures with more modular stem designs, local and systemic effects from metal-on-metal bearings, and fractures with ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, it is not known whether in aggregate the survivorship of these implants is better or worse than the metal-on-polyethylene bearings that they sought to replace. Have alternative bearings (metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-ceramic) and implant modularity decreased revision rates of primary THAs? In this systematic review of MEDLINE and EMBASE, we used several Boolean search strings for each topic and surveyed national registry data from English-speaking countries. Clinical research (Level IV or higher) with \u2265\u00a05\u00a0years of followup was included; retrieval studies and case reports were excluded. We included registry data at \u2265\u00a07\u00a0years followup. A total of 32 studies (and five registry reports) on metal-on-metal, 19 studies (and five registry reports) on ceramic-on-ceramic, and 20 studies (and one registry report) on modular stem designs met inclusion criteria and were evaluated in detail. Insufficient data were available on metal-on-ceramic and ceramic-on-metal implants, and monoblock acetabular designs were evaluated in another recent systematic review so these were not evaluated here. There was no evidence in the literature that alternative bearings (either metal-on-metal or ceramic-on-ceramic) in THA have decreased revision rates. Registry data, however, showed that large head metal-on-metal implants have lower 7- to 10-year survivorship than do standard bearings. In THA, modular exchangeable femoral neck implants had a lower 10-year survival rate in both literature reviews and in registry data compared with combined registry primary THA implant survivorship. Despite improvements in implant technology, there is no evidence that alternative bearings or modularity have resulted in decreased THA revision rates after 5\u00a0years. In fact, both large head metal-on-metal THA and added modularity may well lower survivorship and should only be used in select cases in which the mission cannot be achieved without it. Based on this experience, followup and/or postmarket surveillance studies should have a duration of at least 5\u00a0years before introducing new alternative bearings or modularity on a widespread scale.",

        "abstract": "Preserving bone stock in younger and more active patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is important for future revision. Newer prosthesis designs, including short femoral stems and isoelastic acetabular cups, are likely to preserve more bone stock. However, long-term follow-up studies on bone remodeling after short-stem THA with an isoelastic monoblock acetabular cup are few. Therefore, we evaluated bone preservation after THA using these prostheses at a 5-year follow-up. This prospective observational study is a 5-year follow-up of our previously reported 2-year observational study on the same cohort of patients. We included 45 patients with primary osteoarthritis treated with a calcar-guided femoral short-stem prosthesis and a monoblock press-fit acetabular cup. We evaluated bone mineral density (BMD) around the prostheses using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and reported functional outcomes preoperatively and at 3, 12, 24, and 60 months postoperatively. All complications were recorded. At the final follow-up, the BMD was comparable with that at 24 months in Gruen zones 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, whereas it significantly differed in Gruen zones 1 (P < .0001) and 2 (P < .004). On the acetabular side, the BMD leveled off similarly in all DeLee and Charnley zones between 24 and 60 months (P > .05). Moreover, all measured clinical outcomes significantly improved (P < .001). One perioperative dislocation was reported. Patients undergoing THA with a calcar-guided femoral short-stem prosthesis and a monoblock acetabular cup can expect preservation of bone stock over a longer follow-up with excellent clinical outcomes and few complications.",

        "abstract": "Early ceramic bearing systems in total hip arthoplasty (THA) sought to provide long term wear improvement over traditional metal on polyethylene systems. However, previous designs exhibited fractures of the ceramic acetabular liner, leading to the development of the Implex Hedrocel ceramic bearing THA system where the ceramic liner was supported on a layer of polyethylene intended to transition liner loads to the metal shell, a so-called \"sandwich\" design. Unfortunately, the device trial was stopped to further enrollment when liner fractures were reported. The current study examines nearly 10-year follow-up on 28 devices implanted by two surgeons at one institution in order to document ceramic bearing system performance over a longer time period. Radiographic and patient reported outcomes, in the form of Harris Hip Scores (HHS) and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (sF-12), were collected. During the study period two cups were replaced, one at three years and a second at seven years. At the five year follow-up HHS were similar to those reported in the literature for devices with traditional metal-on-polyethylene bearing surfaces and for other sandwich ceramic bearing designs. At the nine year follow-up, the HHS had not changed significantly and SF-12 scores measuring overall physical and mental health were higher than age matched national norms (p<0.001). There were no signs of cup migration, stem subsidence, osteolysis or cup loosening at any time up to the last follow-up in this patient cohort. The 89% survivorship rate and device revisions due to delamination of the liner observed in this group were similar to those reported earlier for this device and for other \"sandwich design\" ceramic bearing systems. This cohort did not exhibit new failure modes and HHS and SF-12 scores indicated high functionality for the majority of patients. These data suggest that a focus on preventing ceramic liner fracture through design and/or materials improvements may result in a device with long-term functionality.",

        "abstract": "Treatment of femoral bone defects continues to be a challenge in revision total hip arthroplasty (THA); therefore, meticulous preoperative evaluation of patients and surgical planning are required. This review provides a concise synopsis of the etiology, classification, treatment strategy, and prosthesis selection in relation to femoral bone loss in revision THA. A search of literature was conducted for identification of research articles related to classification of bone loss, management of femoral revision, and comparison of different types of stems. Findings of a thorough review of the included articles were as follows: (1) the Paprosky classification system is used most often when defining femoral bone loss, (2) a primary-length fully coated monoblock femoral component is recommended for treatment of types I or II bone defects, (3) use of an extensively porouscoated stem and a modular fluted tapered stem is recommended for management of types III or IV bone defects, and (4) use of an impaction grafting technique is another option for improvement of bone stock, and allograft prosthesis composite and proximal femoral replacement can be applied by experienced surgeons, in selected cases, as a final salvage solution. Stems with a tapered design are gradually replacing components with a cylindrical design as the first choice for femoral revision; however, further confirmation regarding the advantages and disadvantages of modular and nonmodular stems will be required through conduct of higher-level comparative studies.",

        "abstract": "Bipolar hemiarthroplasty has been reliable and successful treatment for geriatric patients following neck of femur fractures. Dissociation/disassembly of bipolar prosthesis is a rare complication in which separation of outer head from inner head leads to failure of prosthesis and needs revision surgery. The disassembly though commonly seen after years of primary surgery as a result of polyethylene wear leading to fixed varus position of outer head but it can happen in an acute setting anytime in immediate or late post-operative period following posterior dislocation with closed reduction attempt. We describe a rare case of disassembly of monoblock (non-modular) bipolar prosthesis following attempt of closed reduction for posterior dislocation of the prosthesis. The patient was a 70-year-old male with 3 weeks prior bipolar hemiarthroplasty of hip joint, presented with posterior dislocation. While manipulation during closed reduction maneuvers, the outer head got locked behind acetabulum and component dissociation happened through bottle opener phenomena. The patient managed with revision surgery in the form of bipolar extraction and revision with total hip joint prosthesis. Disassembly of bipolar prosthesis is a rare and unforeseen complication which obviates for revision surgery. A modular bipolar prosthesis can be reassembled or can be managed with shell, liner, and head exchange with retention of femoral stem but it is impossible to reassemble a non-modular bipolar due to its characteristic locking mechanism. It is vital to look for proper orientation and stability of components, integrity of abductor mechanism and short external rotators, and restoration of horizontal and vertical offsets during revision.",

        "abstract": "Intraprosthetic dislocation (IPD) is a specific implant-related complication of dual mobility (DM) implants, which is defined as a dissociation of polyethylene (PE) liner from the femoral head. We report a unique case of\u00a0 late IPD of a monoblock DM cup cemented into a well-fixed cementless acetabular shell for recurrent dislocation of total hip arthroplasty (THA). A 77-year-old woman was admitted to our department for acute right hip pain, functional impairment and inability to bear weight without any trauma. Three years earlier, she underwent revision THA for recurrent dislocation with a monoblock DM cup cemented into a well-fixed cementless acetabular shell according to the \"double-socket\" technique. Three months after that revision the patient experienced an anterior THA dislocation, which was managed by closed reduction under sedation in the emergency room. No additional episodes of prosthesis instability occurred. Upon admission, radiographic evaluation showed\u00a0 right THA dislocation. X-rays performed\u00a0 after closed reduction revealed eccentric positioning of the head inside the cup, and a direct contact between the metal head and the cup was revealed by subsequent CT scan, confirming the suspicion of IPD. The patient underwent revision surgery, during which the PE liner was found lodged within the cup in a subluxated position, disassembled from the inner head. Both the acetabular cup and modular femoral stem proved well-fixed and impossible to remove, therefore they were retained. The explanted DM components were replaced with new ones of the same size and, thanks to the femoral neck's modular nature, it was substituted with a longer one, which resulted in improved stability against intraoperative stress maneuvers. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. At 1-year follow-up, the patient had a good functional recovery.",

        "abstract": "\"Get It Right First Time\" (GIRFT) and NHS England's Best Practice Tariff (BPT) have published directives advising that patients over the ages of 65 (GIRFT) and 69 years (BPT) receiving total hip arthroplasty (THA) should receive cemented implants and have brought in financial penalties if this policy is not observed. Despite this, worldwide, uncemented component use has increased, a situation described as a 'paradox'. GIRFT and BPT do, however, acknowledge more data are required to support this edict with current policies based on the National Joint Registry survivorship and implant costs. This study compares THA outcomes for over 1,000 uncemented Corail/Pinnacle constructs used in all age groups/patient frailty, under one surgeon, with identical pre- and postoperative pathways over a nine-year period with mean follow-up of five years and two months (range: nine months to nine years and nine months). Implant information, survivorship, and regular postoperative Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) were collected and two comparisons undertaken: a comparison of those aged over 65 years with those 65 and under and a second comparison of those aged 70 years and over with those aged under 70. Overall revision rate was 1.3% (13/1,004). A greater number of revisions were undertaken in those aged over 65 years, but numbers were small and did not reach significance. The majority of revisions were implant-independent. Single component analysis revealed a 99.9% and 99.6% survival for the uncemented cup and femoral component, respectively. Mean patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) improvement for all ages outperformed the national PROMs and a significantly greater proportion of those aged over 65/69 years reached and maintained a meaningful improvement in their OHS earlier than their younger counterparts (p < 0.05/0.01 respectively). This study confirms that this uncemented THA system can be used safely and effectively in patient groups aged over 65 years and those over 69 years, with low complication and revision rates.

        "abstract": "Effective utilisation of blood products is fundamental. The introduction of maximum surgical blood ordering schedules (MSBOS) for operations has been shown to improve transfusion services. A retrospective analysis was undertaken to establish an evidence-based MSBOS for revision total hip replacement (THR) and total knee revision (TKR). The impact of this schedule on blood conservation was analysed. A retrospective analysis was undertaken on 397 patients who underwent revision THR and TKR over a 4-year period. The cross-match-to-transfusion ratio (CTR) and transfusion index (TI) were calculated. A MSBOS protocol was created based on the TIs and its' impact on transfusion services was assessed prospectively on 125 patients by comparing CTRs. In revision THR, TI was 1.19 for elective cases, 1.55 for emergency cases and 2.35 for infected cases. There was no difference in TI for revisions of cemented and uncemented components. Single component THR revision required less transfusion. In revision TKR, TI was 0.31 for elective cases, 2.0 for emergency cases and 1.23 for cases with infection. The introduction of the MSBOS protocol had resulted in a considerable improvement in blood ordering. Reductions in the CTR were seen for all types of revision surgery, but most evident in elective revision THR (3.24-2.18) and elective revision TKR (7.95-1.2). Analysis confirmed that excessive cross-matching occurred for revision lower limb arthroplasty.

        "abstract": "With the success of uncemented fixation in younger patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and the growing demand for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in a younger cohort of patients, there has been an increasing interest in cementless tibial baseplate fixation. We sought to determine whether there was a clear advantage to the use of three different forms of tibial baseplate fixation. The primary outcome of this study was survivorship and secondary outcomes were functional and radiological outcomes, up until 10\u00a0years. We conducted a randomised controlled trial and recruited 224 patients with 274 knees. Patients underwent TKA by a single surgeon utilising a standard surgical technique. All patients received a cruciate retaining TKA with a cementless femoral component, and were randomised to receive either a cemented tibial component, a pegged porous coated cementless tibial component with screws or a cementless tantalum monoblock tibial component with pegs. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMS), radiological data and survivorship were assessed until 10\u00a0years post-operatively. Pre-operative range of motion, alignment and PROMS were similar between the three groups. The use of cemented, cementless with screws or cementless with pegs fixation options, lead to differences in functional outcomes. There was greater improvement in the Oxford score and Knee Society Score in patients who received a cemented baseplate compared to tantalum and the pegged porous groups. However, radiological and survival outcomes were similar in all three groups. Overall survivorship was 99.6%, with one knee with cementless tibial fixation and screws revised for subsidence at 3\u00a0years. There were no cases of venous thromboembolism, periprosthetic fracture or infection. Irrespective of tibial fixation method, functional and radiological outcomes remain similar at follow-up at 10\u00a0years, with no clear difference in outcome between each group. Each method of fixation also had excellent survivorship over this period and should reassure surgeons that whichever method of fixation they choose, long-term outcomes are likely to be satisfactory.",

The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes between non-modular dual-mobility (NDM) implants and small (\u226432 mm) and large (\u226536 mm) fixed-bearing (FB) constructs. A retrospective review of all primary total hip arthroplasties from 2011 to 2021 was conducted at a single, urban academic institution. Patients were separated into 3 cohorts: NDM implant \u226432 mm and FB implant \u226536 mm. Demographics and outcomes such as length of stay, dislocation, and anterior groin pain were assessed. Patients were deemed as having groin pain if they received an iliopsoas injection or had extended physical therapy ordered beyond 3 months postoperatively. There were 178 NDM implants, 936 \u226432-mm FB, and 2,454 \u226536-mm FB implants included. Length of stay significantly differed between the groups (48.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a043.3 vs 63.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040.6 vs 57.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a038.1\u00a0hours; P\u00a0= .001). Although not statistically significant, the \u226536-mm FB cohort had the highest rate of dislocations (0.6% vs 0.7% vs 0.9%; P\u00a0= .84). Although no patients with an NDM implant received an iliopsoas injection, 9 patients (0.9%) with a \u226432-mm FB implant and 9 patients (0.4%) with a \u226536-mm implant received an injection (P\u00a0= .06). However, 18 (10.1%) patients with an NDM implant, 304 (32.5%) patients with a \u226432-mm FB implant, and 355 (14.5%) patients with a \u226536-mm FB implant received extended physical therapy 3 months after surgery (P < .001). NDM implants, as well as FB implants with both small and large head sizes are effective at preventing dislocation. NDM implants did not result in an increase in anterior groin pain compared to \u226432-mm and \u226536-mm FB constructs. Retrospective cohort study.",

The incidence of this problem after total hip arthroplasty with a large-diameter femoral head is unknown. We analyzed the natural history of groin pain and its clinical consequences during the first two years after three types of hip arthroplasty. Data were collected prospectively on 279 patients. Eighty-five patients had a polyethylene sandwich metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty with a 28-mm-diameter femoral head, 105 had hip resurfacing, and eighty-nine had a total hip arthroplasty with a large-diameter femoral head component with three other cup designs (forty-nine in this group had the same monoblock acetabular cup design as those who had hip resurfacing). At the twenty-four-month follow-up evaluation, seventy-seven patients (28%) reported at least one painful area around the hip and thirty-four patients (12.2%) had pain at more than one location. At three months, the incidence of groin discomfort was significantly increased in those who had hip resurfacing (30.5%) and in those who had total hip arthroplasty with a large-diameter femoral head (30%) compared with those who had total hip arthroplasty with a 28-mm femoral head (18.3%). This incidence decreased at two years (14.9%, 16.9%, and 12.9%, respectively). At twenty-four months postoperatively, eleven (four who had hip resurfacing, six who had total hip arthroplasty with the large-diameter head, and one who had total hip arthroplasty with the 28-mm head) of forty-one patients who had groin pain had not reported groin pain at previous follow-up evaluations. Of the forty-one patients reporting groin pain at the time of the last follow-up, twenty-three patients (56%) did not seek further evaluation or treatment, nine had revision surgery (22%), and the remaining nine patients thought the pain was substantial enough to warrant further evaluation and treatment. When the exact source of groin pain cannot be found after total hip arthroplasty, careful follow-up should be done as local reactions to metal-on-metal implants and component loosening may take time to become apparent clinically or on imaging studies.",

Articles referring to dual modular stem usage, survivorship, and complications in English were searched from 2009 to the present day. A qualitative synthesis of literature was carried out, excluding articles referring solely to other types of junctions or problems with cobalt-chromium alloys in detail. In total, 515 records were identified through database searching and 78 journal articles or conference proceedings were found. The reasons for a modular neck fracture of a Ti alloy are multifactorial. Even though dual modular stems have not shown any clinical benefits for patients and have been associated with worse results regarding durability than monolithic stems, some designs are still marketed worldwide. Orthopaedic surgeons should use Ti6Al4V dual modular stem designs for primary THA in special cases only.",

        "abstract": "The use of constrained Total Hip Replacements (THR) is controversial due to lack of definite indications and potentially high failure rates because of mechanical loosening or component failure. A review was performed to assess a departmental use of a single constrained acetabular component over a ten years period. Patient demographics, operative indications, complications and patient follow-up were recorded. Post-operative Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) were obtained via a combination of New Zealand Joint Registry interrogation and telephonic questioning. Cup version and inclination angles were obtained from standardised anteroposterior radiographs using established techniques. Forty-four constrained components (in 39 patients) were implanted between 2005 and 2014. The mean age was 78 years with mean ASA 2.7 and mean follow-up 37.2 months (range 13-116). The mean post-operative OHS was 36 (SD 9.25), and there were 4 failures (3 dislocations and 1 peri-prosthetic fracture). The 3 dislocations had either cup ante version (AV) or inclination angles (IA) outside the data set interquartile range (AV 13-24\u00b0, IA 40-50\u00b0). The cup inclination was significantly lower (p<0.01) in patients with pain on sitting. At post-operative follow-up, 14/39 patients had died from unrelated causes, with only 1 patient surviving beyond 6 years. Constrained acetabular components offer a solution to hip instability in a difficult group of patients. This study has shown good medium-term outcomes of a single component type in a predominantly frail group of low demand patients. Despite constraint, correct cup placement (particularly inclination) remains important to prevent dislocation or poor reported outcome.",

        "abstract": "A patient complained about a squeaking noise in his total hip arthroplasty. Clinical evaluation revealed good function, and there were no signs of loosening on the radiograph. Physiotherapy did not alter this phenomenon, and ultimately a revision was performed 42 months after the first surgery. The analysis of the retrievals revealed that a zirconium oxide ceramic head had been paired with a monolithic alumina ceramic cup. The cup showed large deviations from an ideal sphere but minor wear signs. The head exhibited heavy local damage in the articulation zone. This damage might have been caused by the observed unsatisfactory fit between cup and ball, resulting in high stress concentrations and increased wear of the zirconium head. The characteristics of the zirconium and aluminum ceramics pairing might have worsened the process. The combination of implants used in this retrieved wear couple was never approved. To prevent such problems, components of different manufacturers should never be mixed and matched unless explicitly stated.",

The mean age was 61.1 (range, 41-84) years. The H-Max-M model (Lima, Italy) system was used in all patients. The functional assessment was made by the Harris Hip Score, Short Form-36 (SF-36), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and visual analogue scale for pain. Radiological outcomes were also assessed, and adverse events and complications were noted. The mean follow-up was 6.1 (range, 2-8) years. Functional outcome significantly improved in most patients. There were 3 deep infections (0.9%) and 17 aseptic complications (5.3%) including 1 intraoperative acetabular fracture, 3 later periprosthetic femoral fractures, 1 broken ceramic insert, 1 acetabular loosening, 3 femoral loosening and 1 broken titanium modular neck in a obese patient. No pseudotumors or elevated serum levels of metal ions were found among the patients with radiolucent lines or aseptic loosening. The findings in the present study showed that the H-MAX-M stem provided satisfactory functional outcome in most patients with a low rate of complications attributable to the modular neck design. We consider that using this novel modular neck-stem coupling design can be an alternative to the conventional monoblock stems in patients without overweight.",

The association between PHI and bearing surfaces as well as patient-related factors has been recently investigated, with contradictive outcomes. The dataset of Emilia-Romagna region Registry for Orthopaedic Prosthetic Implants (RIPO) has been assessed to investigate, if the bearing choice influenced the risk of septic loosening occurrence. RIPO data about 39,206 cementless total hip arthroplasties (THA), collected since 2003, were analysed. Age, gender, BMI, diabetes and bearing surfaces were evaluated. The end point of the study was the revision of at least a single component due to sepsis. Adjusted and unadjusted survival rates showed that ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) implants had the lower incidence of PHIs, whereas metal-on-metal (MOM) THAs were significantly more prone to infection. In MOM cohort, stemmed implants were involved in 28 out of 30 cases. Among the demographical features and comorbid conditions, only diabetes statistically influenced the rate of sepsis. Bearing surfaces influenced the rate of PHI; in particular, stemmed MOM implants were at higher risk, probably due to metal debris consequent to taperosis. Despite the preliminary results, stemmed MOM THAs should be used with care, and diabetic patients should be warned about increased septic risks.",

        "abstract": "Early results of contemporary hip resurfacing are encouraging and consequently an increasing number of this procedure has been performed worldwide. A theoretical advantage of hip resurfacing is that failed components can be revised safely and successfully revised to a conventional total hip arthroplasty. As the number of systematically analyzed failures is still limited, however, current data from the literature cannot substantially support this assumption. Our personal results indicate that the conversion of a failed femoral cup (i.e., due to neck fracture or aseptic loosening) to a conventional stem is a relatively simple and safe procedure. If and how potential wear of a firmly integrated acetabular component might have any impact on this type of revision, warrants further investigations. The conversion of acetabular components is influenced by the quality of the remaining pelvic bone stock and can therefore be compared to conventional revision surgery. However, as most providers of hip resurfacings systems only offer one-piece acetabular shells, the possibility of an isolated modular insert exchange is rare. In conclusion, the argument of easy revision surgery after hip resurfacing should be used with care.",

We aimed to investigate differences in demographics, choice of implant selection, surgical approaches, and reoperations between the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register (NHFR) and the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register (SHAR). As part of the Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association (NARA) project a common hemiarthroplasty dataset has been established. 36,989 primary hemiarthroplasties (HAs) for acute hip fractures reported to NHFR (n = 12,761) and SHAR (n = 24,228) for the period 2005-2010 were included. Cemented prostheses were used in 78% of the operations in Norway and in 95% of the patients in Sweden. In Norway HAs almost exclusively had bipolar design (98%), whereas in Sweden HAs with unipolar design were used in 42% of the cases. Monoblock (non-modular) prostheses were uncommon, but still more frequently used in Sweden than in Norway (6.9% and 2.1% respectively). The lateral approach was more common in Norway (83%) than in Sweden (52%), where the posterior approach was used in 42% of the cases. The five-year survival of all HAs was 95.5% (95% CI: 94.8-96.2) in Norway and 94.8% (95% CI: 94.4-95.3) in Sweden. We concluded that surprisingly large differences between the two countries in demographics, implant design, and surgical technique had been revealed.

        "abstract": "Modular dual mobility (DM) prostheses in which a cobalt-chromium liner is inserted into a titanium acetabular shell ( vs a monoblock acetabular component) have the advantage of allowing supplementary screw fixation, but the potential for corrosion between the liner and acetabulum has raised concerns. While DM prostheses have shown improved stability in patients deemed 'high-risk' for dislocation undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA), their performance in young, active patients has not been reported. This study's purpose was to assess clinical outcomes, metal ion levels, and periprosthetic femoral bone mineral density (BMD) in young, active patients receiving a modular DM acetabulum and recently introduced titanium, proximally coated, tapered femoral stem design. This was a prospective study of patients between 18 and 65 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) < 35 kg/m Mean Harris Hip Scores improved from 54.1 (sd 20.5) to 91.2 (sd 10.8) at two years postoperatively (p < 0.001). All patients had radiologically well-fixed components, no patients experienced any instability, and no patients required any further intervention. Mean cobalt levels increased from 0.065 ug/l (sd 0.03) preoperatively to 0.30 ug/l (sd 0.51) at one year postoperatively (p = 0.01) but decreased at two years postoperatively to 0.16 ug/l (sd 0.23; p = 0.2). Four patients (9.3%) had a cobalt level outside the reference range (0.03 ug/l to 0.29 ug/l) at two years postoperatively, with values from 0.32 ug/l to 0.94 ug/l. The mean femoral BMD ratio was maintained in Gruen zones 2 to 7 at both one and two years postoperatively using this stem design. At two years postoperatively, mean BMD in the medial calcar was 101.5% of the baseline value. Use of a modular DM prosthesis and cementless, tapered femoral stem has shown encouraging results in young, active patients undergoing primary THA. Elevation in mean cobalt levels and the presence of four patients outside the reference range at two years postoperatively demonstrates the necessity of continued surveillance in this cohort.

The purpose of this study is to compare the results of DM articulations to jumbo femoral heads of equivalent sizes as they relate to postoperative dislocation. This is a retrospective cohort study of primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed at a single institution between 2005 and 2018. DM articulations and large-diameter metal-on-metal femoral heads were included. Patients were followed with Harris Hip Scores and standard radiographs. Complications were prospectively recorded. Statistical analyses included chi-squared and Brown-Forsythe tests. In total, 1,288 Magnum femoral head THAs and 365 Active Articulation DM THAs were included for analysis. The same monoblock cup was implanted via a posterior approach in all cases. Age, gender, body mass index, and diagnosis were similar between groups. Average follow-up in the DM group was 49 months, and 126 months in the jumbo head group. The average head sizes in the DM and jumbo head groups were 50 mm. There were no dislocations in the DM hips and only 2 (0.2%) in the jumbo femoral head group. Both groups had significant improvements in Harris Hip Score from their preoperative baseline. Our study found similarly low dislocation rates in DM and jumbo femoral heads in primary THA. No evidence currently exists showing a benefit of the DM articulation beyond that of the large effective head size, and we recommend making every attempt at maximizing head size prior to using DM articulations.",

Of the 276 THAs included in this study, there were eleven deaths and 27 patients lost to follow up (11%) during the follow-up, leaving 237 (85%) hips available for review at a mean of 10.5 years (range, 10 to 12) postoperatively. Reoperations, implant revisions, adverse events, clinical outcomes, radiographic evaluation, and whole blood metal ion levels were assessed at the last follow-up. After a minimum of 10 years, implant survivorship was 98.7%. There were 3 revisions (1.3%): one for insufficient acetabular cup primary fixation, one traumatic periprosthetic acetabular fracture, and one probable deep chronic infection. No dislocation or ceramic implant fracture was observed. The mean University of California at Los Angeles activity score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, and Forgotten Joint Score were 5.6 (2 to 10), 90.1 (9 to 100), and 79.2 (4 to 100), respectively. All patients (100%) were satisfied or very satisfied. Since implantation, 43% of patients reported hearing a squeaking noise from the prosthesis. But all patients who reported squeaking were satisfied with the surgery. The mean titanium level was 2.2 \u03bcg/L (1.1 to 5.6). No progressive radiolucent lines, osteolysis, or implant loosening signs were observed at the last radiographic evaluation. A large-diameter head ceramic-on-ceramic THA provides outstanding long-term (minimum 10 years) implant survivorship with unrestricted activity while avoiding implant impingement, liner fracture, and hip instability. Functional outcomes, satisfaction, and joint perception were excellent. Although the incidence of squeaking was high, it did not affect patient satisfaction or function. The systemic titanium levels were low, related to unavoidable passive corrosion of implant surfaces, and did not reveal any indirect signs of trunnionosis.",

This article reports the short-term results (1 year of follow-up) of THA in 235 patients who received a large, anatomically sized femoral head (BFH Technology; Wright Medical Technology, Inc, Arlington, Tennessee) with modular necks for hip stability. The prosthesis allows a 6-mm differential between the size of the acetabular component and femoral head size. Patients also received a Conserve monoblock acetabular cup and a Profemur femoral stem (Wright Medical Technology, Inc) implanted without cement. Postoperative clinical evaluations included measurements of Harris Hip Scores and range of motion, along with assessments of pain and function and radiological evaluations. There were no complications (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, infection, reoperations) and no dislocations. All clinical evaluations showed statistically significant improvement (P<.001) at 1-year follow-up, and radiographic evaluation has shown no evidence of osteolysis or implant loosening. This study indicates that using a large femoral head may reduce the incidence of dislocation and may enable early return to activities postoperatively. Future evaluations of this patient group will elicit longer-term follow-up data.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the change in health-related quality of life of patients receiving a traditional cemented monoblock Thompson hemiarthroplasty compared with a modern cemented modular polished-taper stemmed hemiarthroplasty for displaced intracapsular hip fractures. This was a pragmatic, multicentre, multisurgeon, two-arm, parallel group, randomized standard-of-care controlled trial. It was embedded within the WHiTE Comprehensive Cohort Study. The sample size was 964 patients. The setting was five National Health Service Trauma Hospitals in England. A total of 964 patients over 60 years of age who required hemiarthroplasty of the hip between February 2015 and March 2016 were included. A standardized measure of health outcome, the EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, was carried out on admission and at four months following the operation. Of the 964 patients enrolled, 482 died or were lost to follow-up (50%). No significant differences were noted in EQ-5D between groups, with a mean difference at four months of 0.037 in favour of the Exeter/Unitrax implant (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.014 to 0.087, p = 0.156), rising to 0.045 (95% CI 0.007 to 0.098, p = 0.09) when patients who died were excluded. The minimum clinically important difference for EQ-5D-5L used in this study is 0.08, therefore any benefit between implants is unlikely to be noticeable to the patient. There was no difference in mortality or mobility score. Allowing for the high rate of loss to follow-up, the use of the traditional Thompson hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of the displaced intracapsular hip fracture shows no difference in health outcome when compared with a modern cemented hemiarthroplasty.

        "abstract": "The local and systemic effects of wear debris and corrosion products remain a concern in arthroplasty and reaction to corrosion or wear products from modular junctions has been reported in primary and revision total joint arthroplasties. These effects have not been reported previously for unipolar hemiarthroplasties where there is no prosthetic bearing surface to contribute to the phenomenon. This may have implications for clinical surveillance and implant design. We report the case of a 72-year-old man who had symptomatic pseudotumor formation, confirmed by pathologic examination of the excised pseudotumor, with a large-head modular hip hemiarthroplasty. Metallosis and corrosion of the modular head/neck taper junction were noted at the time of revision surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pseudotumor formation where the corrosion or wear products arose from the modular junction of the implant with no bearing couple present to contribute wear debris that may influence the formation of the pseudotumor. Adverse tissue reactions to wear debris generated at prosthetic articulating surfaces and corrosion and wear products from nonarticulating prosthetic junctions have been reported. The problem has been reported to be higher in metal-on-metal bearing couples and in large-diameter hip arthroplasties. Mixed-alloy junctions appear to be more susceptible to corrosion. We believe that corrosion should be considered a possible diagnostic entity when investigating persistent symptoms after hemiarthroplasty and may be avoided with the use of monoblock components.",

        "abstract": "Most femoral neck fractures are osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. The one-year mortality after neck fracture in this group is 24%.For hemiarthroplasty (HA) the bipolar heads have a risk reduction for reoperation due to acetabular erosion compared with monoblock heads. Surprisingly, the bipolar head had an increased reoperation risk for dislocation, infection and for periprosthetic fracture.Total hip arthroplasty (THA) after fracture has a four-fold raised risk for dislocation compared with THA after osteoarthritis. A larger head on the same neck (head to neck ratio) results in a theoretically larger range of movement and hence less risk for dislocation. The dual mobility bearing has, theoretically, the largest range of movement and good clinical results.Functional results are better for THA compared with HA. Arthroplasty for fracture has much better results compared with arthroplasty after a failed internal fixation; the risk for reoperation is more than doubled for the latter.A Swedish hip arthroplasty register study found a 20-fold higher risk for periprosthetic fracture when comparing uncemented HA with matt cemented HA. Also a polished cemented stem had 13\u00bd-fold higher risks compared with a matt.The mortality during the first day after surgery is higher for cemented compared with uncemented arthroplasties, but lower after one week, one month and one year. Analysing the time points together resulted in no difference.A matt cemented THA with a maximum head size, maybe dual mobility, has the best results, and is also for the low-demanding elderly.",

        "abstract": "Since 1974, we have more than 20 years experience with cementless rehabitable total hip arthroplasty.The purpose of this work is a long term study of development of this type of fixation about a personal series of 83 hips which benefitted from this type of arthroplasty before 50 years old between 1974 and 1980. The implants used are among the oldest. On the acetabular side, we used the BG spiked acetabular component (Fig. 1), containing 4 teeth for primary fixation, 3 equatorial armatures and a surface treatment. This metal back in two sizes 50 and 54 mm, initially permitted the insertion of a polyethylen insert of an interior diameter of 32 mm with a peripheric thickness of 5.5 mm; since 1979, the insert had a 22.2 mm diameter, assuring 10 mm minimal thickness of. The femoral implant (Fig. 2) for 62 hips was the Huchet prothesis, then in 16 cases, the minimadreporic prothesis composed of a morse cone and a head of 22.2, the Huchet prothesis was one-piece femoral implant.The dominant etiology was coxarthrosis (56 cases) of which 50 % had major dysplasis. The average age at the time of the intervention was 41 years old (18-50 years), the follow-up of this series is 17 years, and 8 months (15-21 years). Resumption of former activities was the rule.Results of the rehabitable pro thesis up to 12.31.1995: Of the 83 cases, the outcome of 55 of them (66.3%) is known : 49 (59%) were examined for this study; the evolution has been documented; 28 (33.7%) were uncontactable, 6 patients (7.3%) were deceased between 8 and 9 years following the operation, without having had the hip revised.Among the 49 protheses which were evaluated, 22 (44.9%) have not been revised to date. Clinically, the function is normal and there are no radiological signs of attrition of the insert or mobilisation of implants. There are 10 Huchet Protheses and 12 minimadreporic protheses in this group. The average age at the time of the intervention was 42 years old (30-50 years old), the follow-up was 16 years and 7 months (15-19 years) (Fig. 3a-d).27 hips (51%) needed to be revised, but the causes of reoperationn include different reasons tied to the failure of biological fixation but particularly to errors in the initial concept of the Huchet prothesis.Reoperation linked to the failure of the biological fixation: Out of 7 acetabular implant reoperations, one was carried out systematically on a cup which was perfectly bone-integrated during the changing of a femoral component, 3 were necessary due to perforation (attrition of the insert). Only 3 acetabular implants (6.1%) required reoperation for symptomatic loosening.Four femoral implants (8.6%) have been taken out because of failure of biological fixation between 2 and 11 years follow-up. Finally, for one patient the persistance of the incapacitating crural pain which lasted for more than one year led to the removal of the femoral stem, nevertheless perfectly integrated.Reoperation linked to the concept of the Huchet prothesis: These were undertaken in two sets of circumstances.Changing only the polyethylene insert was only called for in the Huchet prosthesis and concerned 18 hips (36.7%); the delay to reoperation varied from 11 to 18 years with an average of 14 years delay. Changing of the insert had a simple short post-operative outcome and functional recuperation was between 6 and 8 weeks (Fig. 4a-c).Removal for perforative attrition of polyethylene insert causing metal-to-metal wear between head and metal back. Five Huchet prostheses are included in this group, with an average delay to reoperation of 16 years and 3 months (14-19 years). This retrospective study with a 66.3 % rate of re-examination permits three types of comments.The principal cause of revision (23 cases), is linked to polyethylene attrition and is only found in the group with Huchet prosthesis. More than the quality of the polyethylene used at this time, it is its thickness in contact with a 32 mm head which led to the complete removal of the prosthesis in 10.2% of the cases.The second comment argues for the modularisation of the femoral implant. The presence of a stem with a cone and a removable head would have avoided the removal of 5 perfectly bone-integrated femoral implants. Certainly, the literature demonstrates the risk of corrosion generated by the morse cone but it is up to the manufacturers to improve their procedures.Finally, the third comment concerns the current state of the long term of the biological fixation by rehabilitation with surface treatment. With 17 years 8 months follow-up (15-21 years), 81.6% of components are still fixed, the real failure of the bony ingrowth of 10.2% is comparable to the rate of failure in long term follow-up of totally cemented prothesis found in young subjects. With more than 20 years follow-up for the older cases, the concept of the biological fixation of an implant by bony ingrowth using surface treatment seems to be very reliable.The experience of this long term study argues for the thickness of polyethylene to be at least 10 mm for all metal back acetabular component and the future of this kind of implant seems to lie in modularisation made possible by the morse cone which would allow the replacement of the bearing surfaces.",

The PCA total hip was one of the first hip implants to offer uncemented fixation by bone ingrowth. It was used in the younger patients with adequate bone stock. While most arthroplasties were performed for osteoarthritis, it was also used in rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis and dysplastic hips. Revisions were excluded in this series. Bone grafts (autograft) were used to reconstruct the acetabulum in segmental and contained defects. All components were inserted without cement. In all cases a 32 mm femoral head was used. In cases of protrusion often the deep socket design was inserted for reestablishment of the anatomic hip rotation center. Initial cup stability was aimed for by line to line reaming while rotatory stability was augmented by the presence of two peripheral pegs. A maximum contact with the acetabular rim was always aimed for. A variation of the straight lateral approach was used in all cases. In a prospective study the clinical scores were evaluated. X rays were evaluated on AP and lateral views taken immediately after the operation, at two years and at latest follow-up. Cup migration was recorded when there was a change in cup angle, vertical migration of more than two millimeters. Polyethylene (PE) wear was recorded in case of eccentric localisation of the femoral head in the cup. The relationship between PE wear and cup size was also recorded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The aim of the present analysis was to present the main figures of unicompartmental knee implants processed from the Registry. During the period 2000-2011, 3929 unicompartmental knee arthroplasties were performed on 3645 resident patients, of which 71% were females. The medial condyle was treated in 94% of cases, where mean age at surgery was 67.3 years and mean body weight was 76.6 kg. The main outcome measure was time to revision of at least one single component. The Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox multivariate analyses have been applied. At 10-year follow-up, the percentage of survival was 86.8% (confidence interval (CI) at 95% was 84.1-89.5); total aseptic loosening represented 42% of the causes of failure, pain represented 15%, and sepsis represented 11%. Age at surgery significantly influences the survival of the prosthesis, whatever the reason for revision, while the type of tibial component (monoblock or metal tray) does not appear to be a determinant. Septic failure is not prevented by the use of antibiotic-loaded cement.

        "abstract": "Cementless metal-back acetabular cups have good long-term results, but some problems have appeared due to the shell's stiffness, modularity and required bearing surfaces. The RM Pressfit Cup is a single-piece polyethylene cementless acetabular cup that is covered by a thin layer of titanium. This allows for bone integration without limitations related to the stiffness of a metal-back shell. There is very little published information about this new, innovative implant design. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results from a continuous series of 91 cups (85 patients) with a follow-up of at least 4 years. No patients were lost to follow-up. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used to assess the clinical outcome. To assess the radiological outcomes, digital X-rays were used to evaluate the cup position and integration; wear was measured using Livermore's technique. The clinical results were excellent: the mean HHS was 94 and 82% of cases had good or excellent scores. Three of the cups had to be revised because of dislocation brought on by incorrect positioning. X-rays revealed that three implants had shifted during the first 6 weeks, but had stabilized afterwards. Bone integration on X-rays was satisfactory in all cases with no signs of osteolysis. The configuration of the bone trabeculae showed that loads between the implant and peri-acetabular cancellous bone were evenly distributed. The wear of the polyethylene cup-ceramic head bearing was 0.07 mm/year. The results of this series are consistent with recent published studies with the RM Pressfit Cup. IV.",

Large ceramic head sizes up to 48\u2009mm can now be used with monoblock acetabular components. National registries have shown promising results at short-term with large diameter ceramic-on-ceramic THA, with very low revision rates.This study reports on the average 3-year follow up of a press-fit monoblock large diameter acetabular shell with a pre-assembled ceramic liner, with emphasis on the radiographic outcome, complications related to the implantation of the cup, and the patient's clinical outcome. 170 hips in 169 patients were reviewed at an average 38 \u00b1 5.8\u2009months following surgery. The radiographic review revealed no acetabular cup loosening, no osteolysis and no cup migration. 1 acetabular cup was revised for malposition. The patient clinical outcome and the satisfaction rate were excellent. At 3\u2009years, 7.1% of patients complained of groin pain and 3.5% spontaneously reported hip joint generated noise. 1 patient sustained a non-recurrent traumatic hip dislocation 2\u2009years post surgery. New technology should be introduced cautiously on the market. This is especially true for the large diameter ceramic monoblock acetabular component used in this study since it involves a new acetabular component design. At short term, we have not identified new modes of failure with this implant. Longer follow-up is still needed to assess the safety of large ceramic bearing in THA.",

        "abstract": "Recent total hip arthroplasty designs have introduced modularity at the neck-stem junction. There are reports of failure of this class of designs due to corrosion at the modular junction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients implanted with a recently recalled modular total hip arthroplasty system. This was a prospective study of 216 total hip arthroplasties in 195 patients performed by a single surgeon. All hips had a titanium-alloy stem, but 199 had a modular cobalt-chromium neck and seventeen were monolithic. The mean patient age was 65.4 years (range, twenty to eighty-eight years); seventy-nine were men and 116 were women. Patients were evaluated for infection and with metal ion assays and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Intraoperative tissue samples were graded, and retrieved implants were examined. At a mean follow-up of 19.3 months, eighty (37%) of 216 hips had been revised. An adverse local tissue reaction (ALTR) was the cause for revision in seventy-three of these eighty hips; all had the modular neck design. Assay results for the patients requiring revision showed higher levels of cobalt (mean, 8.6 ng/mL) than chromium (mean, 1.8 ng/mL). MRI showed moderate to severe levels of synovial response in sixty-three of 166 hips. The mean ALVAL (aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesion) score for the revised hips was 8.1. Corrosion was visible on all tapers at the neck-stem junction but not the head-neck junction. Early failures of modular total hip arthroplasty occur due to fretting and corrosion at the neck-stem junction, resulting in ALTR. Surveillance utilizing metal ion levels and MRI may be indicated for all patients regardless of symptoms, as the early survivorship is poor and the ultimate failure rate may be catastrophically high.",

Both cementless sockets articulated with alumina ceramic femoral ball heads for total hip joint replacements. Clinical followup of patients with hemispheric monolithic alumina ceramic sockets (Group 1, 138 sockets) resulted in a total failure rate of 19.6% after 5 to 20 years. Radiologic analysis of eight stable sockets showed migration of 0.2 mm to 2.89 mm, but in four sockets at risk for late aseptic failure after an average followup of 12.5 years as much as 13.4 mm of migration was seen. Histologic evaluation revealed pseudosynovial membranes as thick as 1 mm with fine birefringent wear particles within mononuclear macrophages around two stable retrieved sockets. The membranes around four loose sockets were 6 to 10 mm thick and also heavily loaded with larger alumina wear particles. After 7 years followup clinical analysis of patients with modular titanium sockets with alumina ceramic inlays (Group 2, 30 sockets) resulted in four revisions, compared with one revision of 50 identical sockets (control group) with polyethylene instead of alumina ceramic inlays. Wear particle analyses in scanning electron microscopy showed significantly more particles (x 10(9) +/- standard deviation/g dry tissue) from the control group (4.26+/-6.38), compared with alumina ceramic bearings of Group 1 (0.70+/-0.79), and of Group 2 (1.62+/-2.13). The alumina particle sizes ranged between 0.13 and 78.38 microm. The mean annual linear wear of 38.8 microm was calculated for the bearings in Group 1, and of 26.94 microm for bearings in Group 2.

        "abstract": "Approximately 37% of patients undergoing lower extremity revision total joint arthroplasty (TJA) receive allogeneic blood transfusions (ABTs), which are associated with increased risk of morbidity and death. It is important to identify patient factors associated with needing ABT because the health of higher-risk patients can be optimized preoperatively and their need for ABT can be minimized. Our goal was to identify the patient and surgical factors independently associated with perioperative ABT in revision TJA. We included all 251 lower extremity revision TJA cases performed at our academic tertiary care center from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. We assessed the following factors for associations with perioperative ABT: patient age, sex, race, body mass index, preoperative hemoglobin level, and infection status (ie, infection as indication for revision TJA); use of vasopressors, tranexamic acid (TXA), surgical drains, tourniquets, and intraoperative cell salvage; and procedure type (hip versus knee), procedure complexity (according to the number of components revised), and surgical time. Multivariable regression was used to identify factors independently associated with perioperative ABT. The following characteristics were independently associated with greater odds of perioperative ABT: preoperative hemoglobin level (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 2.2), infectious indication for revision (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 9.7), and procedure complexity. TXA use was a negative predictor of ABT (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.98). Compared with polyethylene liner exchanges, single-component revisions (OR, 14; 95% CI, 3.6 to 56) and dual-component revisions (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 2.3 to 26) were associated with greater odds of ABT. Patients with preoperative anemia, those undergoing revision TJA because of infection, those who did not receive TXA, and those undergoing more complex TJA procedures may have greater odds of requiring ABT. We recommend preoperative optimization of the health of these patients to reduce the need for ABT. Level III, prognostic study.",

        "abstract": "Total hip replacement is one of the most successful surgical procedures of the modern surgical era. The method of fixation of implants continues to evolve, and as cemented acetabular fixation appears to be less durable than anticipated, the use of a cemented stem and an uncemented acetabulum - a so-called 'hybrid hip'- has become more popular. This paper reports the results of hybrid total hip replacement at an average of 10 years postoperatively. Primary hybrid total hip replacements carried out by a single surgeon in 1994 and 1995 were identified; patients were sent Oxford Hip Score and EuroQuol-5 Dimension quality-of-life questionnaires and, where necessary, a radiograph appointment. Questions about diabetes, cigarette smoking and hip dislocation were included. First postoperative and final radiographs were compared for stem subsidence, cup migration, stem position, osteolysis of the femur and pelvis, and evidence of loosening of both components. At 10-year follow up the revision rate for femoral component loosening was 2.9%. Fifteen per cent showed some abnormality at the femoral interface, not related to stem size and more common in titanium stems. Average hip score was 20.9, and quality-of-life measures indicated a high level of satisfaction. Hybrid total hip replacement gives excellent clinical outcomes with low revision rates for both components. The one-piece uncemented cup offers important advantages over modular devices, the use of which should be re-evaluated.",

Complications of these systems are not yet fully understood. This study aims at characterizing in\u00a0vivo performance of DM hip systems and assessing modes of clinical failure. Under an institutional review board-approved implant retrieval protocol, 18 DM THA systems from 17 patients were included. Implants were graded at the head-neck junction for fretting and corrosion based on the system of Goldberg et\u00a0al. Components were also macroscopically examined for different damage modes. Demographics and surgical data were collected from medical records, and radiographs were assessed for component positioning. Data were analyzed through Spearman rank-order correlation and Mann-Whitney U-tests, with \u03b1\u00a0= 0.05. The average length of implantation was 13.4 months with mild to moderate fretting corrosion damage. Polyethylene (PE) liners exhibited edge deformation, scratching, and pitting damage. Metallic components exhibited burnishing and scratching damage. Summed fretting and corrosion scores were strongly correlated (\u03c1\u00a0= 0.967, P < .0001). Summed corrosion score was moderately correlated with presence of embedding on the PE liner (\u03c1\u00a0= 0.690, P\u00a0= .017). PE liner abrasion and edge deformation of the femoral stem taper were moderately positively correlated (\u03c1\u00a0= 0.690, P\u00a0= .017). Fretting and corrosion damage were not significantly correlated with patient demographics or radiographic positioning of implants. There were no differences in scores between modular and monoblock designs. These findings demonstrate that dual-mobility THA systems may be susceptible to the same fretting and corrosion damage observed in traditional modular THA systems. Future studies are needed to confirm these results and clinical significance.",

        "abstract": "Fracture of the femoral stem is the cause of ~1\u00a0% of revisions after total hip arthroplasty. The risk increases intrinsically with modularity, whereby modularity is particularly useful in revision arthroplasty. We present 7 cases of failure of a specific modular, tapered, fluted, titanium alloy Revitan stem and analyse the different failure modes. Retrospective review of all Revitan stems revised at our institutions due to implant failure and analysis of clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and failure mode. The retrieved components were analyzed by optical and scanning electron microscopy. A total of 7 cases were included. There was a significant time lag between symptom onset and correct diagnosis. Conventional radiographs and low-dose CT scans (CT scout imaging) were decisive for diagnosis. All failures occurred at the level of the connection between the proximal component and the distal part of the stem. Three different failure modes were identified: loosening of the proximal component, fatigue fracture of the connection pin, and distal loosening of the connection pin. No alterations of the microstructure or deviation from manufacturing specifications regarding dimensions were observed. Failure was caused by mechanical overload. Conventional radiographs are the mainstay in identifying failed modular stems. Repeated radiographs and low-dose CT scans may be helpful additions. No single modification of the connection will address all possible failure modes. Modularity of revision stems offers advantages up until insertion of the definitive stem. Monoblock definitive stems might overcome the potential mechanical weaknesses of modularity and should be considered in relatively young, heavy and active patients.",

        "abstract": "The cementless fixation of porous coated femoral stems is a common technique employed for Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). With the rate of revision surgery appearing to rise and younger more active patients requiring primary surgery it can be thought that alternative methods for increasing implant longevity need to be considered. The stress shielding of periprosthetic bone still remains a contributing factor to implant loosening, caused through a mismatch in stiffness between the implant and the bone. However, the ability to achieve stiffness matching characteristics is being realised through the use of Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) technologies and Functionally Graded Materials (FGM). This paper proposes an alternative design methodology for a monoblock Cobalt Chrome Molybdenum (CoCrMo) femoral stem. It hypothesises that a femoral stem suitable for cementless fixation can be manufactured using Laser Melting (LM) technology offering orthotropic functionally graded porous structures with similar mechanical properties to human bone. The structure and mechanical properties of the natural femur have been used as a basis for the design criteria which hypothesises that through a combination of numerical analysis and physical testing, an optimal design can be proposed to provide a lightweight, customised femoral stem that can reduce the risk of implant loosening through stress shielding whilst maintaining bone-implant interface stability.",

        "abstract": "A 24-year-old patient with a history of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis underwent a primary cementless left total hip arthroplasty (THA). The original THA consisted of an Optifix 54 cup with a 3-mm thick polyethylene liner, an Optifix size 4 stem (Smith & Nephew Richards, Memphis, Tennessee) and a Biolox aluminum 32-mm femoral head. Fourteen years later, radiographs demonstrated extensive wear of the polyethylene liner resulting in direct articulation and abrasion wear of the ceramic femoral head on the cup and a bubble sign. This article presents a case of a catastrophic failure of a ceramic/polyethylene bearing with destruction of the polyethylene liner and the metallic shell and protrusio of the nonfractured ceramic head through the metallic shell. To our knowledge this is the first description of extensive metallosis and subsequent radiograph bubble sign not presenting as a result of wear of a metal-on-metal articulation. At the time of revision surgery-Hydrocel TNT Monoblock 58 cup (Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana), Wagner 265/14 stem (Zimmer), and a Co/Cr 28-mm head-copious metallic debris was seen both macroscopically and histologically, with the ceramic head protruding behind the metallic shell. Multiple factors may have been responsible for this failure including a thin polyethylene shell, a suboptimal locking mechanism, gamma in air sterilization for polyethylene, multiple screw-holes that reduce the contact surface between shell and polyethylene, the rough surface on the inside of the shell and non-articular wear at the metal polyethylene interface within the acetabular component and the high demands of this active young patient.",

        "abstract": "Modular total hip arthroplasty (THA) components have evolved significantly as the success of uncemented femoral fixation has been proven. Current trends in the United States include widespread use of cementless components (acetabular and femoral), usually with monoblock femoral stems with modular heads. Femoral offset has been proven to play a vital role in hip abductor strength, hip range of motion, and hip stability. Also critical to hip stability is the orientation of the acetabular and femoral components. Thus, offset and component positioning are fundamental to success in THA. Modularity of the femoral neck has been proposed to aid in further customizing the THA component fit. Neck-modular stems enable the adjustment of leg length, femoral anteversion, and femoral offset independently of stem size. Modularity of the neck allows the surgeon to precisely match the anatomic characteristics of each patient to yield improved range of motion, stability, abductor strength, and leg length equality. Disadvantages are related to cost and the addition of another interface. Neck-modular femoral stems are not a new concept; however, as tough component manufacturing has advanced, these stems have been reintroduced to the armamentarium of the hip surgeon.",

        "abstract": "Dislocation remains common after total hip arthroplasty. Efforts have been made to identify and minimize risk factors. One such factor, jump distance, or the distance the femoral head must travel before dislocating, has been poorly characterized with respect to three-dimensional kinematics. We therefore determined: (1) the three-dimensional stability of four different component designs; (2) whether the degree of abduction and anteversion affects the stability; (3) whether pelvic inclination angles affected stability; and (4) which combination of these three factors had the greatest stability. We created a positionable three-dimensional model of a THA. Acetabular components were modeled in various abduction and anteversion angles and in two different pelvic inclinations which simulate standing and chair-rising activities. The posterior horizontal dislocation distance increased as inclination angle and femoral head size increased. The 48-mm resurfacing typically had lower jump distances and was at risk of posterior edge loading at 30\u00b0 inclination. The highest jump distance for all positions and activities occurred with the dual-mobility bearing. These findings suggest that monoblock cups require extremely accurate positioning for low dislocation risk and that pelvic orientation may increase dislocation risks. As a result of the dual-mobility designs having the greatest resistance to dislocation, these cups may be appropriate for patients who are at risk for dislocation in difficult primary situations and in revision hip arthroplasty procedures in which proper component orientation may be less likely to be achieved.",

        "abstract": "The authors discuss arguments concerning indications and selection of implants and operative techniques for arthroplasty in the treatment of femoral neck fractures. Their analysis is based on long-term experience with surgical treatment of patients with hip fractures and on the evaluation of a large number of publications by well-known specialists. The assessed group included 4795 patients treated at their institution between 1997 and 2010, of whom 1532 underwent hip replacement, with 1032 receiving hemiarthroplasty (HA) and 500 having total hip replacement (THR) indicated for femoral neck fractures. A painful hemiarthroplasty due to acetabular cartilage erosion and subsequent head protrusion is still a challenging clinical problem. The most important factor in prevention of this complication remains strict adherence to indication criteria. A metal monoblock hemiarthroplasty should be indicated only in very old patients with serious co-morbidities or in patients whose pre-operative mobility has been greatly restricted. For the other cases, a modular prosthesis is preferred because it allows for more exact alignment and, if necessary, its conversion to a total hip prosthesis is relatively easy. The stem to be implanted should be the one used in standard THR procedures. A ceramic modular head then enables hemiarthroplasty to function for long with a low risk of cartilage erosion and head protrusion. Even if the choice of an optimal prosthesis, in terms of its biomechanical and biological properties, has been correct, the prosthesis' long life span and good functioning still depends on the surgeon's adherence to the principles of the correct operative technique (the head centre situated 1 to 2 mm below the level of the apex of the greater trochanter, 12- to 15-degree anteversion, articular capsule suture, and re-insertion of external rotator tendons if the Koch-Langenbeck approach is used. This is the only way of minimising acetabular erosion and other complications. Indications for total replacement include, in addition to fractures at joints affected by arthritis, most often a displaced fracture of the femoral neck found in younger patients still in good general health with a good prospect for a long life. Even if dislocation and loosening occur in these patients more often than in those with a THR procedure indicated for other reasons (primary or post-dysplastic arthritis), this therapy offers fewer complications and longer functioning in comparison with other methods of treating femoral neck fractures. A cemented prosthesis can be regarded as the standard implant; however, if the proximal femur shows good quality cortical bone, an uncemented implant can be used without a greater risk of future loosening. In the absence of hip arthritis which leads to the development of subchondral sclerosis required for the correct acetabular cup fixation, a hybrid THR with an expansion cup or a screw-in cup is recommended.",

        "abstract": "Dual mobility (DM) refers to a now widely available option for total hip articulation. DM implants feature a small inner head, a hard bearing, that connects via a taper fit onto the femoral trunnion. This head freely rotates but is encased inside a larger, outer polyethylene head that articulates with a smooth acetabular component. DM acetabular components are available in the form of a monoblock shell or as a liner that is impacted into a modular shell, providing a metal articulation for the polyethylene outer head. DM is designed to increase hip stability by providing the arthroplasty construct with a higher jump distance, head-to-neck ratio, and range of motion prior to impingement. The use of DM in total hip arthroplasty continues to increase in the United States for both primary and revision arthroplasty. Surgeons should be aware of the potential benefits and pitfalls. Long-term data are lacking, especially for modular DM implants.

The resurgence of new and better-engineered metal-on-metal bearings has provided the means to develop a viable prosthetic solution from a concept that was once abandoned. The lessons drawn from the early resurfacing era led to modern designs all using a cementless fixation of the acetabular component and a short metaphyseal stem designed for component alignment on the femoral side. Currently, only metallic devices can be manufactured with sufficient strength as a thin one-piece shell, combining excellent wear properties for large femoral heads and a bone-conserving device on the acetabular side.

        "abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an effective intervention for the treatment of arthrosis with excellent survivorship. Nonetheless, dislocation and osteolysis remain significant complications. A dual-mobility acetabular component has been advocated to improve stability and wear. Stability is imparted by increasing the effective femoral head size, which allows a larger range of motion (ROM) before neck-socket impingement occurs. Increasing ROM, however, introduces an additional problem of bony impingement of the trochanter against the pelvis. Consequently, there is little improvement in ROM for heads >36 to 40 mm. A 0.4% incidence of instability at the larger articulation has been reported in primary THA using the dual-mobility liner, which is equivalent to reports for conventional THA. The dual-mobility liner has introduced the unique complication of intraprosthetic dislocation, where the femoral head dissociates at the smaller articulation as a result of polyethylene wear. An incidence of intraprosthetic dislocation of 3.6% has been reported, which far exceeds dislocation of conventional arthroplasty. The dual-mobility liner is a monoblock acetabular component without the capacity for augmented bony fixation. Inability to achieve primary stability has been reported as high as 18% and therefore its usefulness in revision THA is questionable. Proponents of the dual-mobility liner cite improved wear characteristics over conventional THA; however, few studies support this proposition. Retrieval studies have reported that the dual-mobility liner does not avoid wear or osteolysis. Theoretically, it is inconceivable that wear would be diminished with an additional articulation with a huge surface area, where the differential hardness has been reversed to a soft-on-hard bearing.",

To improve bony integration, monoblock cups surfaced with ceramic beads were introduced. For the past 10 years, there has been a trend towards the use of modular acetabular components comprising a metal shell and a liner made of Biolox forte ceramic. Two concepts for the fixation of the ceramic liners are employed: locking of the ceramic in the metal shell (CeraLock) and the sandwich concept with a polyethylene layer interposed between liner and shell.

        "abstract": "Despite the clinical success of modern metal-on-metal articulations, concerns with wear-related release of metal ions persist. Evidence suggests metal ion release is related to the effective coverage of the head in the metal shell (the cup's functional articular arc). A recent study suggests a reduced functional articular arc is associated with increased ion release and the arc is a function of component design, size, and the abduction angle. The purposes of this study were to (1) measure the functional articular arc in different sizes of currently available one-piece metal shells from several different manufacturers; and (2) compare the functional articular arc of these one-piece metal shells with the 180 masculine arc of conventional hip arthroplasty acetabular components. We calculated the available articular surface arc for 33 one-piece metal cups using measurements of cup depth and internal cup radius. The arc of the articular surface varied among manufacturers and generally decreased with decreasing shell diameter. The mean functional articular arc was 160.5 degrees +/- 3.6 degrees (range, 151.8 degrees -165.8 degrees), which was less than the 180 degrees arc of a conventional acetabular component. Our data show certain cup designs are at higher risk for failure as a result of the decreased articular surface arc. This, along with analysis of abduction angles, supports the recent findings of bearing failure with vertically placed implants. Care must be taken when implanting these shells to ensure they are placed in less abduction to avoid edge loading and the potential for early bearing failure.",

        "abstract": "Cementless custom implants attempted to enhance fit and fill of variable hip geometry. Fabrication of custom implants in referenced from a computed tomography scan, thus allowing three dimensional specifications of femoral anatomy. However, the aggregate charge of manufacturing the implant and obtaining the computed tomography scan is prohibitive in today's healthcare climate. Clinical studies have not shown that customized implants incrementally improve clinical success or implant longevity. Modular prostheses allow the surgeon intraoperative versatility, allowing adjustment of leg length, offset, neck length, anteversion, and fixation. This is particularly helpful in developmental dysplasia of the hip and posttraumatic arthritis. Other advantages of modularity include decreased implant inventory and the ability to remove the femoral head at revision surgery to improve exposure or change head size without component removal. Subsequent clinical experience has witnessed significant drawbacks associated with modularity. These include corrosion, especially with mixed metals, fretting, dissociation, implant fracture below the head and neck taper joint, and reduced range of motion. In addition, thin acetabular polyethylene contributes to higher were rates, earlier failure, local or distal debris particles, and osteolysis. Finally, the cost of modular implants is generally higher than a comparable monolithic prosthesis. In primary hip arthroplasty, use of custom or modular implants should be judicious. Modularity beyond the head and neck junction should be reserved for those cases where a comparable monolithic implant would not suffice.",

        "title": "Technical Note on Modified Posterior Approach to the Hip Joint.",
        "abstract": "The posterior approach is the most commonly and relatively easy to be used to expose the hip joint. Posterior approaches allow excellent visualization of the entire acetabulum and the upper femoral shaft, and thus they are popular for revision joint replacement surgery particularly in cases where only the femoral component needs to be replaced. There may be a higher dislocation rate with minimal movement as compared to anterior approaches if the posterior approach is used in fractured neck of femur surgery in demented or elderly bedridden patients who often lie crouched in bed with their hips in a flexed and adducted position. The expected purpose of this modification of the Posterior Approach to the Hip Joint is to overcome the fear of dislocation and hence combine the advantages of the Posterior route with greater stability. The author's original paper written 30 years ago (Iyer, 1981) presented an original technique devised to confer greater stability to the hip joint posteriorly to minimize the greater incidence of dislocation which has been reported extensively in literature. The technique involves an osteotomy of the posterior overhanging part of the greater trochanter to include the insertions of the short lateral rotators along with the posterior third of the gluteus medius, which can then be turned back in one piece like the page of a book to include the capsule of the hip joint. This gives wide exposure of the posterior lip of the acetabulum and is relatively bloodless in its exposure. This approach is very useful in the elderly particularly demented patients requiring a hemiarthroplasty and also in primary and revision total hip replacement. This approach has been tested in cadavers to conclude the greater stability given as compared to the routine resuture or reattachment of the short lateral rotators. The modified technique provides for greater stability as compared to the Southern Approach.",

        "abstract": "The bone loss associated with revision surgery or pathology has been the impetus for developing modular revision total hip prostheses. Few studies have assessed these modular implants quantitatively from a mechanical standpoint. Three-dimensional finite element (FE) models were developed to mimic a hip implant alone (Construct A) and a hip implant-femur configuration (Construct B). Bonded contact was assumed for all interfaces to simulate long-term bony ongrowth and stability. The hip implants modeled were a Modular stem having two interlocking parts (Zimmer Modular Revision Hip System, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) and a Monoblock stem made from a single piece of material (Stryker Restoration HA Hip System, Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA). Axial loads of 700 and 2000 N were applied to Construct A and 2000 N to Construct B models. Stiffness, strain, and stress were computed. Mechanical tests using axial loads were used for Construct A to validate the FE model. Strain gages were placed along the medial and lateral side of the hip implants at 8 locations to measure axial strain distribution. There was approximately a 3% average difference between FE and experimental strains for Construct A at all locations for the Modular implant and in the proximal region for the Monoblock implant. FE results for Construct B showed that both implants carried the majority (Modular, 76%; Monoblock, 66%) of the 2000 N load relative to the femur. FE analysis and experiments demonstrated that the Modular implant was 3 to 4.5 times mechanically stiffer than the Monoblock due primarily to geometric differences. This study provides mechanical characteristics of revision hip implants at sub-clinical axial loads as an initial predictor of potential failure.",

Radiographic records for 4116 consecutive patients who underwent a hip hemiarthroplasty between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2017 at 3 acute hospitals (including a regional major trauma center) for a neck of femur fracture were reviewed in conjunction with United Kingdom National Hip Fracture Database records. In total, 4116 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study; 63 of 4116 (1.5%) dislocations were identified. Patient age, gender, preoperative abbreviated mental test score, postoperative abbreviated mental test score, and American Society of Anaesthesiologists grade were not found to be significant predictors of dislocation rates (P < .05). The Furlong prosthesis was the most commonly used implant (2280/4116, 55.4%) followed by the Exeter V40\u00a0+ Unitrax head (1179/4116, 28.6%), other implants used during the study period were the monoblock Austin-Moore and Thompson implants. Hemiarthroplasty operations undertaken with the Thompson (24/273, 3.7%) were found to have significantly higher dislocation rates (P < .05). Cemented vs uncemented, variable vs fixed offset, and monoblock vs modular implant designs did not contribute to higher dislocation rates (P < .05). Surgeon seniority was also not a significant risk factor for subsequent dislocation (P < .05). Thompson hip hemiarthroplasties are associated with higher dislocation rates when compared to a contemporaneous cohort of implant choices and considerations for their use should be made in conjunction with this major risk factor for the need for subsequent operations.",

The paper explores a brief historical summary related to dual-modular stems, including the complications associated with their use, diagnostic tools for evaluation, analysis of both recalled and currently available models, as well as alternative therapeutic options. This information is pertinent for both clinical and research domains. While dual-modular systems were initially touted to offer several advantages, the evidence substantiating these benefits has been ambiguous. Further, these systems introduce the risk of alternative complications. In specific cases involving patients with developmental hip dysplasia and certain proximal femoral deformities requiring complex reconstructions, dual-modular systems might be relevant.

We describe the hemiarthroplasty population in Sweden 2005 through 2009. Since 2005, the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register has registered hemiarthroplasties on a national basis. We assessed hemiarthroplasty procedures in the Register 2005-2009 regarding patient details, implants, and surgical techniques. Completeness of recordings was calculated compared to the Swedish National Patient Register. Completeness increased from 89% to 96% during the study period. 21,346 hemiarthroplasty procedures were assessed. The relative number of patients with femoral neck fracture as diagnosis increased from 91% to 94%; the proportion of men increased from 27% to 30%. The median age increased from 83 to 84 years in men and from 84 to 85 years in women. Patients classified as having evident cognitive impairment increased from 19% to 22%. More men than women were ASA 4. The proportion of monoblock-type implants (Austin-Moore and Thompson) decreased from 18% to 0.9%. Modular implants increased generally, but in 2009 bipolar implants decreased in favor of unipolar implants. Lubinus and Exeter stems, and Mega Caput and Vario Cup implant heads were most common. The use of uncemented implants decreased from 10% to 3%. Use of the anterolateral approach increased from 47% to 56%. Important changes in surgical technique and implant choice occurred during the observation period. We interpret these changes as being reflections of the continuing effort by Swedish orthopedic surgeons to improve the quality of treatment, because the changes are consistent with recent findings in the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register and in other scientific studies.",

        "abstract": "Anecdotal reporting of osteolysis around cementless modular acetabular components with holes through the metal shell and/or iliac fixation screws has raised concern that such designs may generate excessive particulate debris and/or permit direct access of particulate debris to iliac bone. To address this issue, incidence data are reported on 513 total hip replacements from six different single-surgeon series of total hip arthroplasties performed with six different porous ingrowth acetabular components. With follow-up ranging from 40 to 108 months, a total of 45 pelvic osteolytic lesions were observed (8.8 per cent). Pelvic osteolysis was seen nearly as frequently in the ischium and pubis (21 lesions) as it was in the ilium (24 lesions). It was not possible to explain ischial and pubic osteolysis by holes and/or screws through the acetabular component shell. There was no direct correlation between the presence of screw holes or screws and the incidence of pelvic osteolysis. The incidence of pelvic osteolysis around modular components with holes through the shell was 4.5 per cent (14 of 313 hips). The incidence of pelvic osteolysis with solid-shell components was 15.5 per cent (31 of 200). The incidence of pelvic osteolysis around acetabular reconstructions with screws was 2.3 per cent (3 of 133). The incidence of pelvic osteolysis in reconstructions without screws was 11.1 per cent (32 of 380). The incidence of pelvic osteolysis in one-piece acetabular components (polyethylene pre-fixed in the metal shell) was 12.7 per cent (21 of 165) and the incidence of pelvic osteolysis with the modular components was 6.9 per cent (24 of 348). In each comparison, the incidence of pelvic osteolysis was actually lower in the group assumed to be at increased risk. Based on this review there does not appear to be a direct relationship between holes and/or screws through an acetabular component and the development of pelvic osteolysis. The incidence of pelvic osteolysis was associated with larger head diameters and longer follow-up. While screw holes may provide an access channel in specific cases, the present data indicate that the simple elimination of holes through the acetabular shell will not eliminate pelvic osteolysis. Regardless of other acetabular component design features, joint fluid and polyethylene wear particles from the femoral-acetabular articulation can gain access to bone behind an acetabular component via the peripheral implant-bone interface through regions without sufficient contact or tissue ingrowth. The development of pelvic osteolysis is multifactorial and includes the total volumetric wear of polyethylene as well as specific features of the acetabular component design and reconstruction technique.",

        "abstract": "The Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system (Smith and Nephew) was developed as an alternative to conventional total joint replacement for younger, more active patients. Among other complications exists the risk for femoral component failure. The only marketed revision option for such a complication involves exchange of all components for a total replacement arthroplasty. This presents as a considerable and potentially unnecessary operative burden where revision of only the femoral prosthesis would suffice. We have analysed revision options for BHR in the context of periprosthetic femoral fractures with a stable acetabular component. Technical details of dual mobility hip systems available in Australia were collated and analysed to assess for potential 'off label' use with an existing BHR acetabular component. These data were then compared with the custom-made Smith and Nephew dual mobility implant with respect to clearance and sizing. Two dual mobility articulation modalities from two companies were identified as appropriate for potential usage with four products analysed in detail. These two demonstrated acceptable sizing and clearance measurements. Comparison between readily available dual mobility prostheses with custom-made implants showed off label dual mobility prosthetic use to be a viable alternative for femoral-only revisions with in situ BHR. Single component revision has several advantages which include: a less complex surgical procedure, shorter operative time, decreased blood loss and the expectation of resultant lower morbidity. Furthermore, this less complex revision surgery should give comparable results to that of primary total hip arthroplasty.",

        "title": "Preoperative Planning for Total Hip Arthroplasty for Neglected Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip.",
        "abstract": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is accompanied by morphological alterations on both the acetabular and the femoral side. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) provides effective treatment in cases of neglected DDH but requires elaborate preoperative planning. To determine the morphological changes resulting from the dysplasia, the anatomic acetabular position, the height of the femur head dislocation, the height of the femur head dislocation, and the combined anteversion must all be established. In addition, a vital and complicated process of strategizing leg length balance must be conducted in cases of severe DDH. Each type of leg length discrepancy (LLD), including bony and functional and anatomical LLD, should be evaluated in the context of the presence or absence of a fixed pelvic tilt. Moreover, with severe unilateral dislocated hips, a more inferior change in the original rotational center of the hip must be accounted for. Due to these multiple morphological changes, the accurate size of the prosthesis and the cup position are difficult to predict. In comparison with other methods, CT scan-based 3-dimensional templating provides the best accuracy. Despite the presence of anatomic alterations, various types of acetabular and femoral prostheses have been developed to treat hip dysplasia. Both cemented and cementless cups are used in DDH cases. In DDH accompanied by insufficient acetabular bone stock, a cemented cup combined with bone graft provides a reliable treatment. Monoblock stems can be used when the combined anteversion is less than 55\u00b0, and a modular stem system when this parameter is greater than 55\u00b0. Customized stems can be designed for DDH coupled with severe proximal femoral distortion. A ceramic-on-ceramic bearing is considered optimal for young DDH patients.",

        "abstract": "In the current era of total hip arthroplasty (THA), orthopedic surgeons have several fixation options at their disposal. The modern monoblock prosthesis, introduced by Dr. Sir John Charnley, has seen many modifications since its inception in the 1970s and continues to be the most commonly used prosthesis style for primary and revision THA. Proximal modular sleeve technology was introduced in 1967 by Konstantin Sivash, modifying his original 1956 Sivash Stem design. The design is now known as the S-ROM, and although design modifications continue to date, the fundamental structure of the S-ROM remains essentially unchanged. Several other proximal modular prostheses are now currently available for use in THA. Although this similarity in design enables considerable surgical flexibility, it also links their potential for catastrophic failure. This aim of this article was to present a brief history of proximal modularity in THA and to add to the small body of literature regarding catastrophic failure in modular hip implants, including its proposed etiologies including micromotion, fretting and corrosion.",

        "abstract": "The authors report on a case of modular femoral neck fracture which appeared 21\u00a0months after revision of acetabular component. The revision surgery was performed 8\u00a0years after the primary total hip arthroplasty due to aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. During acetabular revision, the primary implanted short (S, -\u20093.5\u00a0mm) femoral head was also exchanged with extra-long (XL, +\u20097.0\u00a0mm) femoral head fitting the modular femoral neck with a longer lever arm. Numerical analysis has shown that this has resulted in a 19.9% increase in tensile stress at the neck-stem coupling during normal walking cycle. This could result in microcrack initiation and propagation and finally lead to modular neck failure of the otherwise well-fixed stem. Surgeons should avoid excessive loading of the exchangeable neck (dual-modular) femoral stem designs as the stem-neck couplings are subject to corrosion and are not as reliable as monoblock stems.",

        "abstract": "Stress shielding of the periprosthetic femur following total hip arthroplasty is a problem that can promote the premature loosening of femoral stems. In order to reduce the need for revision surgery it is thought that more flexible implant designs need to be considered. In this work, the mechanical properties of laser melted square pore cobalt chrome molybdenum cellular structures have been incorporated into the design of a traditional monoblock femoral stem. The influence of incorporating the properties of cellular structures on the load transfer to the periprosthetic femur was investigated using a three dimensional finite element model. Eleven different stiffness configurations were investigated by using fully porous and functionally graded approaches. This investigation confirms that the periprosthetic stress values depend on the stiffness configuration of the stem. The numerical results showed that stress shielding is reduced in the periprosthetic Gruen zones when the mechanical properties of cobalt chrome molybdenum cellular structures are used. This work identifies that monoblock femoral stems manufactured using a laser melting process, which are designed for reduced stiffness, have the potential to contribute towards reducing stress shielding.",

        "title": "Cementing a Monoblock Dual-Mobility Implant into a Fully Porous Cup in Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty to Address Hip Instability: Surgical Technique.",
        "abstract": "The use of a cemented monoblock dual-mobility implant into a fully porous cup is indicated for patients with acetabular bone loss who have a high risk of postoperative hip instability. Patients undergoing lumbar fusion for sagittal spinal deformities have an increased risk of hip dislocation (7.1%) and should be assessed on sitting and standing radiographs With use of the surgeon's preferred approach, the soft tissue is dissected and the hip is aspirated. The hip is dislocated and a subgluteal pocket is made with use of electrocautery to mobilize the trunnion of the femoral stem to aid in acetabular exposure. The femoral component is assessed to ensure appropriate positioning with adequate anteversion. The acetabular component and any acetabular screws are removed. A \"ream to fit\" technique is performed in the acetabulum until bleeding bone is encountered, with minimal reaming performed in healthy bone from the posterior column. A trial prosthesis is placed within the acetabulum to evaluate if there is satisfactory fixation and if any augment is necessary. Care must be taken during reaming to ensure that enough bone is reamed to accommodate a porous shell that can fit the monoblock dual-mobility implant with a 2-mm cement mantle. Smaller porous shells measuring 56 mm are available for smaller defects but are often not utilized in cases of substantial acetabular bone loss. Fresh-frozen cancellous allograft is utilized to fill any contained defects. The revision porous shell with circumferential screw holes is utilized to allow for screw fixation posterosuperior and anterior toward the pubis. The implants are dried prior to placement of the cement. The cement is applied to the shell and the monoblock dual-mobility implant to ensure adequate coverage. Antibiotic-loaded cement can be utilized according to surgeon preference. Excess cement is removed under direct visualization while the cement is drying, and the position of the dual-mobility implant is adjusted in approximately 20\u00b0 anteversion and 40\u00b0 inclination. Stability is assessed after the cement cures, and intraoperative radiography can be performed to confirm cup positioning prior to closure. Any remaining capsule is closed, followed by closure of the remaining soft tissue in a layered fashion. A fully porous multi-hole jumbo cup with conventional polyethylene liner and femoral head can be utilized to increase the jump distance of the femoral head. Constrained, lipped, or offset polyethylene liners can be utilized if the shell is well fixed and a dual-mobility implant cannot be inserted. A cemented dual-mobility implant can be utilized in a well-fixed acetabular shell without evidence of loosening or osteolysis. Dual-mobility implants have become increasingly utilized because of their advantages: (1) ability to decrease dislocation rate without increasing constraint and (2) increasing range of motion with reduced impingement risk The use of a dual-mobility implant is a viable treatment option in cases of revision total hip arthroplasty, particularly those in which postoperative stability is a concern; monoblock dual-mobility implants cemented into porous shells are particularly useful in this setting In order to allow for circumferential coverage for fixation and ingrowth potential in cases with acetabular defects, the shell is typically impacted slightly vertical (45\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 of inclination) and in neutral version (0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 of anteversion). Positioning can be adjusted to improve osseous contact and ingrowth as determined by the size and shape of the defect.The use of a drill guide for the locking screws allows limited degrees of variable screw angulation. In the revision setting, longer screws may be placed posterosuperior toward the sciatic notch or anteroinferior into the pubis. Surgeons should be aware of the anatomy and should predrill holes to reduce the risk of injury to surrounding neurovascular structures such as the obturator artery anteriorly.Any screw holes that are not filled should be covered with plastic hole covers in order to prevent cement from migrating behind the cup. Implants should be dried prior to the placement of the cement, and the cement should be applied to the shell and the dual-mobility implant to ensure adequate coverage.Utilize a monoblock dual-mobility implant that is designed for cementation in order to avoid implant dissociation from the acetabular shell.Remove all fibrous tissue that may hinder bony integration.Assess for pelvis discontinuity; pelvis discontinuity and acetabular bone loss are risk factors in the setting of any revision and should be properly assessed preoperatively and intraoperatively and managed accordingly.Avoid over-reaming and damage of the posterior column.Utilize a reamer or trial to assess defect size and need for augments.Place a compression screw where the cup is in contact with the bone in order to avoid tilting.Cover unused screw holes.

At revision heads and cups were marked for orientation. Maps were drawn of wear patterns with the use of light microscopy and surveyed by SEM. In a simulator experiment 28-mm-diameter alumina heads and liners were used. The cups were mounted inverted in a hip simulator and run with calf serum as the lubricant. The hip loads were 2 kN maximum and a 1-Hz frequency for 20 million cycles. Wear severity was classified into five grades. In retrieved implants, SEM analysis showed that the main wear zones (MWZ) had Grade 4 wear. The peripheral wear zones (PWZ) showed grain pull-out regions (Grade 5 wear). These corresponded to neck-socket impingement and head-acetabular cup separation. Gray was due to transferred CoCr particles from the stem. In the simulator study, the MWZ had only localized areas of grain pull out surrounded by polished surface regions (Grade 4 wear) at 20 million cycles; stripe wear was not seen. The alumina ceramic bearings proved excellent up to 22 years in simulator studies and clinical studies.

        "abstract": "Cementless hip cups require adequate primary stability in order to achieve osseointegration. Depending on implant design, a different biomechanical behavior in osteoporotic bone and in bone with normal bone mineral density might be expected. The micromovement between bone and implant was determined in macerated human hip acetabula with reduced and with normal bone density for two different cementless screwed cups and two different cementless press-fit cups. The bone mineral density was assessed by means of Q-CT and 20 implantations were performed for each acetabulum with reduced and with normal bone density. Screwed cups showed significantly less micromovement than press-fit cups. The average micromovement of all cups, with the exception of the Monoblock cup, remained below the value of 100\u00a0\u00b5, the upper limit for successful osseointegration. Values of over 200\u00a0\u00b5 were measured only for the Monoblock cup and only in some of the tests. There was no significant difference between the micro-movement in acetabula with reduced bone mineral density and with normal bone. Impaired osseointegration in osteoporotic bone because of increased micromovement is not to be expected in the investigated cementless hip cups as no relevant differences in micromovement were found between normal and osteoporotic bone stock. On the basis of the good clinical results with the Monoblock cup, the upper limit of 100\u00a0\u00b5 of micromotion for osseointegation in macerated bone is probably set too low.",

This explains why the gold-standard implant of this form from the past half-century had a diameter of only 22.225 mm (7/8 in). Metal-on-metal implants can operate in the mild mixed lubrication regime in which much of the applied load is supported by elastohydrodynamic films. Correct tribological design leads to remarkably low steady state wear rates. Promotion of the most effective elastohydrodynamic films calls for the largest possible head diameters and the smallest clearances that can reasonably be adopted, consistent with fine surface finishes, good sphericity and minimal structural elastic deformation of the cup on its foundations. This guidance, which is opposite in form to that developed for metal-on-polymer joints, is equally valid for solid (monolithic) metallic heads on metallic femoral stems and surface replacement femoral shells. Laboratory measurements of friction and wear in metal-on-metal joints have confirmed their potential to achieve a very mild form of mixed lubrication. The key lies in the generation of effective elastohydrodynamic lubricating films of adequate thickness compared with the composite roughness of the head and cup. The calculation of the film thickness is by no means easy, but the full procedure is outlined and the use of an empirical formula that displays good agreement with calculations based upon the full numerical solutions is explained. The representation of the lambda ratio, lambda, embracing both film thickness and composite roughness, is described.",

        "abstract": "To enable a comparison of different pressfit acetabular cups objective criteria are essential. The aim of this study is to describe the design features of this type of cup and to analyse currently available cups. 30 implants were systematically measured and analysed. The mean surface roughness (Ra) was determined and configurations established with the light section technique. For further evaluation the cups were transversely sectioned. The cups are made of pure titanium, titanium alloy or polyethylene coated with titanium. Five implants take the form of monoblocks. The configuration is predominately (n = 25) flattened spherical. The size of eight cups corresponds to the outer diameter, 19 cups have a larger outer diameter (overdimensioning), 3 cups have a smaller outer diameter (underdimensioning). The magnitude of overdimensioning is, on average, 1.9%. 9 cups are provided with plugs, hollow cylinders, fins or rings as outer stabilizers. Surface roughness achieved with corundum blasting is 6.8 microns. Titanium porous-coated implants have a surface roughness of 21-32 microns. 24 cups have polyethylene inserts, most of which are snap-fixed with equatorial lips. For 16 cups, full-ceramic inserts are available. 4 cups have a metal insert. Titanium implants with structured or HAC-coated surfaces have become the accepted standard for cementless acetabular cup implantation. Together with ceramic, metal, or modified polyethylene inserts they meet the requirement for permanent osteo-integrative stability.",

        "abstract": "Cementless hip cups need sufficient primary tilting stability to achieve osseointegration. The aim of the study was to assess differences of the primary implant stability in osteoporotic bone and in bone with normal bone density. To assess the influence of different cup designs, two types of threaded and two types of press-fit cups were tested. The maximum tilting moment for two different cementless threaded cups and two different cementless press-fit cups was determined in macerated human hip acetabuli with reduced (n=20) and normal bone density (n=20), determined using Q-CT. The tilting moments for each cup were determined five times in the group with reduced bone density and five times in the group with normal bone density, and the respective average values were calculated. The mean maximum extrusion force of the threaded cup Zintra was 5670.5 N (max. tilting moment 141.8 Nm) in bone with normal density and.5748.3 N (max. tilting moment 143.7 Nm) in osteoporotic bone. For the Hofer Imhof (HI) threaded cup it was 7681.5 N (192.0 Nm) in bone with normal density and 6828.9 N (max. tilting moment 170.7 Nm) in the group with osteoporotic bone. The mean maximum extrusion force of the macro-textured press-fit cup Metallsockel CL was 3824.6 N (max. tilting moment 95.6 Nm) in bone with normal and 2246.2 N (max. tilting moment 56.2 Nm) in osteoporotic bone. For the Monoblock it was 1303.8 N (max. tilting moment 32.6 Nm) in normal and 1317 N (max. tilting moment 32.9 Nm) in osteoporotic bone. There was no significance. A reduction of the maximum tilting moment in osteoporotic bone of the ESKA press-fit cup Metallsockel CL was noticed. Results on macerated bone specimens showed no statistically significant reduction of the maximum tilting moment in specimens with osteoporotic bone density compared to normal bone, neither for threaded nor for the press-fit cups. With the limitation that the results were obtained using macerated bone, we could not detect any restrictions for the clinical indication of the examined cementless cups in osteoporotic bone.",

Designs that incorporate a metaphyseal sleeve taper fit with a splined, slotted distal body of varying lengths and neck offsets and also provide infinite choices for version of the components. Designs incorporate a distal stem with various proximal stems and Morse tapers. These designs also may vary the distal stem configuration from extensively porous-coated, to tapered and with corundum, to splined and slotted. Although there have been no clinical studies that document improved outcomes with modular stems over one-piece stems, the intraoperative flexibility provided by choices of diameter, stem length, fixation type, and proximal stem size and orientation enable establishment of a stable hip center.

        "abstract": "Modularity is defined as separation of a system into independent parts or modules that can be treated as logical and may be separated and recombined. Historically, the modularity represents the evolution of the concept of \"low friction arthroplasty\" developed by Sir J. Charnely in 1960. The disadvantage of a one-piece stem is the difficulty of restoring the biomechanical feature of the hip. Thus, the natural evolution was the introduction of modularity on both sides, the acetabulum and the femur. Modularity allows the surgeon to accurately match the anatomic characteristics of each patient to obtain improved range of motion, joint stability, abductor strength, and leg length equality. Disadvantages are related to the introduction of different interfaces, which could be sites of wear and corrosion. In accordance with the most recent literature, in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) the modularity can be reduced to the head and the acetabular component, while a one-piece stem can manage the majority of cases. On the other hand, we believe that during revision surgery, a complete modularity is necessary.",

        "abstract": "Fretting corrosion as one reason for failure of modular hip prostheses has been associated with micromotion at the head taper junction. Historically the taper diameter was reduced to improve the range of motion of the hip joint. In combination with other developments, this was accompanied by increased observations of taper fretting, possibly due to the reduced flexural rigidity of smaller tapers. The aim of the study was to investigate how the flexural rigidity of tapers influences the amount of micromotion at the head taper junction. Three different stem and two different taper designs were manufactured. Experimental testing was performed using three different activity levels with peak loads representing walking, stair climbing and stumbling. The relative motion at the head-stem taper was measured in six degrees of freedom. Micromotion was obtained by subtraction of the elastic deformation derived from monoblock and finite element analysis. Less rigid tapers lead to increased micromotion between the head and stem, enlarging the risk of fretting corrosion. The influence of the stem design on micromotion is secondary to taper design. Manufacturers should consider stiffer taper designs to reduce micromotion within the head taper junction.",

The examination was stratified according the pole and the rim areas as a press-fit cup with an extended rim was used. Two animals had a hip dislocation after 8 weeks and these animals were excluded from the study and replaced. The cups were appraised as stable in the bony bed. Histologically, the rim area of the acetabular cup showed a higher osseointegration rate than the pole area. The rate of osseointegration in total was 3% after 8 weeks and 7% after 52 weeks. The rim area furnished 5.1% after 8 and 8.6% after 52 weeks. At the pole the osseointegration was 1,2% after 8 and 5.5% after 52 weeks. No significant differences were seen between both assessed time periods regarding the osseointegration rates. The bone showed an interlocking aspect with the pores of the coating as bony tissue was determined in the pores. The presented pilot study revealed a stable osseointegration of porous-coated AMC-ceramic monoblock cups one year after surgery in a weight-bearing animal model. Interlocking of bone and porous coating may provide a stable osseointegration in the presence of low osseointegration rates, whose enhancement seems to be preferable.",

        "abstract": "The use of dual-mobility articulations in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is increasing. The appeal of dual-mobility implants rests in their ability to increase the effective ball head size for a given THA construct compared with conventional bearings, thereby reducing the risk of postoperative instability. Although the concept of dual-mobility articulation in THA is not new and early clinical experience dates back to the 1970s, its widespread use is a relatively recent phenomenon. Furthermore, unlike European surgeons who routinely use monoblock dual-mobility acetabular components in THA, the most common dual-mobility implants used in North America and worldwide are of a modular nature in which a metallic liner is coupled to a multibearing acetabular component and thus creating a metal-on-metal interface. It is important to review the evidence for the indications for dual-mobility implants in both primary and revision THA; present basic science data on the risk of corrosion in modular dual-mobility implants; and highlight the possible ongoing questions and concerns with dual-mobility implants. The goal is to provide a balanced critical review of this technology and define its current place in the hip surgeon's armamentarium.",

        "title": "[Biomechanical aspects of the implant fixation and kinematics of hip resurfacing systems].",
        "abstract": "Hip resurfacing is undergoing a resurgence in orthopaedic surgery with an increasing number of implantations. The objective of this article is to present the biomechanical basics of implant anchorage as well as the kinematics of hip resurfacing implants.Today, fixation of the femoral component onto the prepared femoral head is mainly done using bone cement. Depending on the implant design, the bone structures beneath the femoral component can be exposed to stress shielding, followed by degradation of the bone density and subsequent initiation of implant loosening. However, the trabecular bone has the ability to adapt itself to the fixation peg, to additional cement pegs, and to the elastic properties of the femoral component as well. The acetabular component is mainly inserted into the bone stock without using cement. Provided that large prosthetic heads will be applied, thin-walled acetabular cups are crucial for bone-saving preparation of the acetabular bone stock. Nearly all hip resurfacing systems are currently based on metal-on-metal wear-bearing couples. The acetabular components are mainly designed as monoblock implants, which can make subsequent revision difficult. Kinematic analyses show a significantly lower range of motion of hip resurfacing implants compared with modern standard (stemmed) total hip replacement systems. This difference originates from the small ratio of the resurfaced femoral head diameter and the relatively thick neck of the femur. Impingement of the femur neck onto the rim of the acetabular component can result in subluxation, deformation of the bearing surfaces, femoral neck fracture, and impairment of the bony anchorage of the hip resurfacing implants.",

        "abstract": "An effective lubrication can significantly reduce wear of metal-on-metal artificial hip joints. The improvement of the lubrication can be achieved through the optimisation of the bearing geometry in terms of a small clearance and/or the structural support such as a polyethylene backing underneath a metallic bearing in a sandwich acetabular cup form. The separate effects of these two factors on fluid film lubrication of 28 mm diameter metal-on-metal total hip joints under walking conditions were numerically investigated in this paper. The results show that a larger lubricant film due to the polyethylene backing can be significantly enhanced by the transient squeeze-film action, particularly during the stance phase, and a similar lubricant film can be developed for both the monolithic cup relying on the smaller clearance and the sandwich cup benefiting from the polyethylene backing. Both cup systems can function in a wide range of lubrication regimes, covering both mixed and fluid film, under the current design and manufacture conditions.",

        "abstract": "The elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) analysis was carried out in this study for a 28 mm diameter metal-on-metal hip prosthesis employing a metallic cup with an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) backing under a simple steady state rotation representing the flexion/extension during walking. Both Reynolds and elasticity equations were coupled and solved numerically by the finite difference method. The elastic deformation was determined by means of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique using the displacement coefficients obtained from the finite element method. Excellent agreement of the predicted elastic deformation was obtained between the FFT technique and the conventional direct summation method. The number of grid points used in the lubrication analysis was found to be important in predicting accurate film thicknesses, particularly at low viscosities representative of physiological lubricants. The effect of the clearance between the femoral head and the acetabular cup on the predicted lubricant film thickness was shown to be significant, while the effect of load was found to be negligible. Overall, the UHMWPE backing was found not only to reduce the contact pressure as identified in a previous study by the authors (Liu et al., 2003) but also significantly to increase the lubricant film thickness for the 28 mm diameter metal-on-metal hip implant, as compared with a metallic mono-block cup.",

        "abstract": "The interference press fit of a metallic one-piece acetabular cup employed for metal-on-metal hip resurfacing procedures was investigated experimentally under laboratory conditions in the present study, in particular regarding the cup deformation. Tests were carried out in cadavers as well as polyurethane foams of various grades with different elastic moduli to represent different cancellous bone qualities. The cadaver test was used to establish the most suitable configuration of the foam model representing realistic support and geometrical conditions at the pelvis. It was found that a spherical cavity, with two identical areas relieved on opposite sides, was capable of creating a two-point pinching action of the ischeal and ilial columns on the cup as the worst-case scenario. Furthermore, the cup deformation produced from such a two-point loading model with a grade 30 foam was similar to that measured from the cadaver test. Therefore, such a protocol was employed in subsequent experimental tests. For a given size of the outside diameter of the cup of 60 mm, the cup deflection was shown to be dependent largely on the cup wall thickness and the diametral interference between cup and prepared cavity at implantation. For a relatively thin cup with a wall thickness between 2.3 mm (equator) and 4 mm (pole) and with a modest nominal diametral interference of 1 mm, which corresponds to an actual interference of approximately 0.5 mm, the maximum diametral cup deflection (at the rim) was around 60 microm, compared with a diametral clearance of 80-120 microm between the femoral head and the acetabular cup, generally required for fluid-film lubrication and tribological performances. Stiffening of the cup, by both thickening and lateralizing by 1 mm, reduced the cup deformation to between 30 and 50 microm with actual diametral interferences between 0.5 and 1 mm.",

        "title": "[Shock absorption by intermediate hip prostheses].",
        "abstract": "The bipolar prosthesis was developed in an attempt to alleviate acetabular wear of conventional metallic endoprostheses. The prosthesis was designed to achieve low-friction metal-on-polyethylene inner bearing motion while decreasing shear stress across the acetabular cartilage. Although good clinical results were obtained, the principle of a persistent inner mobility was contested and some authors have assigned the delay of cartilage erosion to the shock absorption capacity of the polyethylene. The present study was focused on assessing the vibration and shock damping effect of metal monoblock and bipolar head prostheses. The transmission of the shock wave through these two types of prostheses was studied in vitro. The two heads were first tested in a rigid environment to eliminate all external parasite frequencies. The impact excitation was applied with a hammer connected to an oscillometer. A second accelerometer was connected to the prosthesis stem. Shock wave transmission was analyzed. Secondly, the head was tested with a system vibrating in the same order of frequencies as the skeleton, with and without pre-constraint. The frequency response functions were analyzed. For the metallic prosthesis, the frequency of vibration recorded on the femoral stems was in a large frequency range from 0 Hz to 10 KHz. For the bipolar prosthesis, all the high frequencies of the shock wave were eliminated and only shock wave frequencies from 0 to 500 Hz were recorded. In an environmental system vibrating below 100 Hz, the metallic head did not express high frequencies of vibration. The coefficient of shock absorption was not significantly different for the two heads. In the first rigid environment, the metallic head did not filter the high frequency components of the shock wave and the bipolar head tended to eliminate high frequency components due to the flattening effect of the impulse load by the polymer. But, the lower leg is not a rigid structure and the musculo-skeletal system vibrates in frequencies below 100 Hz. In similar conditions, the increased shock-absorbing effect of the polyethylene is far more difficult to observe. For the metallic prosthesis, the recorded frequency of vibration also belongs to a small domain of frequency, from 0 Hz to 100 Hz. The range of frequency is similar for the two types of prostheses. Even though polyethylene is characterized by a more pronounced damping capacity than metallic materials, in experimental conditions simulating the vibratory characteristics of the human body, the introduction of a high-density polyethylene liner does not afford any additional shock-absorbing effect compared with a metallic head. It cannot explain cartilaginous sparing.",

The evolution of the total hip from the one-piece, all-polyethylene acetabular component and fixed-head femoral component to the myriad of parts that comprise many of today's total hip designs has brought with it an array of potential mechanisms for failure that were not present in the earlier design. The risk/benefit ratio of these new designs may need to be reevaluated based on the additional mechanisms for failure that they provide. One hundred eleven acetabular hip prostheses and 139 femoral prostheses, all of modular configuration, retrieved by surgeons in the field, and sent for histologic examination, were analyzed for this study. A number of component characteristics were found to be correlated to early failure. These included acetabular designs with thin polyethylene bearings, poor fixation of the polyethylene to the metal shell, and geometries that permitted a moment to be applied to the bearing insert, tending to cause it to rotate in the metal shell. Modular femoral components were observed to be susceptible to corrosion, with titanium-alloy stems mated to cast cobalt-alloy heads at greatest risk attributable to a galvanic effect. All modular connections of femoral and acetabular components are at risk for disassociation and fretting; therefore, clever design and precision machining are necessary to produce prostheses in which the benefits of modularity exceed the risks.",

        "abstract": "Fretting corrosion is one contributor to the clinical failure of modular joint arthroplasty. It is initiated by micromotion in metal junctions exposed to fluids. Omitting metal-on-metal contacts could help to reduce the corrosion risk. The coating of one metal taper partner with a ceramic-based silicon nitride (SiNx) coating might provide this separation. The aim of the study was to identify whether a SiNx coating of the male taper component influences the micromotion within a taper junction. Hip prosthesis heads made of CoCr29Mo6 (Aesculap) and Ti6Al4V (Peter Brehm) were assembled (2000\u2009N) to SiNx-coated and uncoated stem tapers made of Ti6Al4V and CoCr29Mo6 (2\u00d72\u00d72 combinations, each n\u2009=\u20094). Consecutive sinusoidal loading representing three daily activities was applied. Contactless relative motion in six degrees of freedom was measured using six eddy-current sensors. Micromotion in the junction was determined by compensating for the elastic deformation derived from additional monoblock measurements. After pull-off, the taper surfaces were microscopically inspected. Micromotion magnitude reached up to 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 \u00b5m during loading that represented stumbling. Ti6Al4V stems showed significantly higher micromotion than those made of CoCr29Mo6, while taper coating had no influence. Statistical differences in pull-off forces were found for none of the taper junctions. Microscopy revealed CoCr29Mo6 abrasion from the head taper surface if combined with coated stem tapers. Higher micromotion of Ti6Al4V tapers was probably caused by the lower Young's modulus. Even in the contact areas, the coating was not damaged during loading. The mechanics of coated tapers was similar to uncoated prostheses. Thus, the separation of the two metal surfaces with the objective to reduce in vivo corrosion appears to be achievable if the coating is able to withstand in vivo conditions. However, the hard ceramic-based stem coating lead to undesirable debris from the CoCr29Mo6 heads during loading.",

Modularity reduces inventory and increases the surgeon's options in both primary and revision total-joint arthroplasty. Use of a modular interface, however, increases the risk of fretting, wear debris, and dissociation and mismatching of components. The use of modular heads in total hip replacement is firmly established. The occurrence of corrosion and fretting has been recognized, and most manufacturers have improved the quality of the interface to minimize these problems. Modular polyethylene liners also offer advantages, particularly in revision procedures, where the option of additional screw fixation remains important. Many uncemented acetabular components are inserted without screws, which may generate renewed interest in one-piece factory-preassembled components. The conformity, locking mechanism, and nonarticular interface of modular acetabular components have all been studied and improved. Modular tibial components offer additional flexibility in the performance of total knee replacement but introduce the risk of dissociation and increased polyethylene wear; in revision procedures, modularity provides a valuable option for dealing with bone loss and an additional method of fixation by means of press-fit stems. Modular humeral components offer a significant advantage with limited apparent risk; however, longer clinical experience is required to assess potential problems.",

The development of the \"isoelastic\" hip is based on the hypothesis that the matching of the material modulus to that of cortical bone will result in an optimal stress transfer to the bone, resulting in a minimal bone loss. The biomechanical data showed no statistical difference in strain transfer in the bone before or after implantation of low modulus stems. The clinical reports of a number of earlier \"isoelastic\" devices showed evidence of loosening and lack of stability. The current interest has been in the development of femoral components made from carbon fiber reinforced polyaryletherketone, polysulfone, and carbon/carbon composites. As these materials are optimized, it is important to look into matching the rigidity of bone. Moreover, the unsupported neck area needs to be as strong as metal, like Ti6-Al4-V, to prevent failure, whereas the femoral component inside the bone needs to have lower rigidity. Therefore, monolithic composite material from neck area to the distal stem will not withstand the loading needs and a material optimization scheme is required to come up with a long-lasting composite device.

        "title": "Patterns of stress distribution at the proximal femur after implantation of a modular neck prosthesis. A biomechanical study.",
        "abstract": "Modular total hip arthroplasty incorporating a double taper design is an evolution offering potential advantages compared to single head-neck taper or monolithic designs. Changes in femoral offset, neck length or femoral anteversion are expected to alter the strain distribution. We therefore analyzed the strain patterns after usage of all types of necks of a modular neck prosthesis, implanted in composite femurs. The load distribution presented a repeatable pattern. Anteverted neck combinations resulted in higher stress at the anterior surface, whereas the retroverted ones at the posterior (e.g. at the middle frontal site, stress is 13.63% higher when we shifted from the long neutral neck to the long 15\u00b0 anteverted neck and at the middle back site 19.73% higher when we shifted from the long neutral to the long 15\u00b0 retroverted neck). Compressive stress was larger at the calcar region and exacerbated by the use of the varus neck (e.g. at the frontal 1 site stress increased by 44.01% when we used the long 8\u00b0 varus neck in comparison to the long neutral neck). Anteverted neck combinations resulted in higher strain at the anterior cortex around the tip of the prosthesis. Short necks exhibited lower stress at the femoral shaft and higher at the trans-trochanteric area. Anteverted neck combinations could be more prone to anterior thigh pain. Because of the possible risk of adaptive hypertrophy and early mechanical failure due to increased stress, the surgeon should be cautious when using necks with combined characteristics or short necks.",

        "abstract": "Fluorescence microprobe spectroscopy was applied to in situ assessments of contact stress and local temperature at the contact point of dry-sliding couples during wear tests of two commercially available ceramic-on-ceramic femoral heads. The investigated ceramic hip implants consisted of either monolithic Al2O3 or Al2O3/ZrO2 composite. A specially designed pin-on-ball tribometer was employed, which enabled directly testing the femoral head components as received from the maker without further manipulation. The strong fluorescence emission from Cr(3+) impurities contained in Al2O3 served as a responsive sensor for both temperature and stress. Analytical corrections for the averaging effects arising from the finite size of the laser probe were made according to a probe response formalism in which geometrical conditions of the sliding couple were incorporated as boundary conditions. The sample-probe interaction at the contact point was then experimentally calibrated by obtaining probe response functions for the two materials investigated. Based on such theoretical and experimental procedures, deconvolutive computational routines could be set up and the true variations of local temperature and stress at the contact point of the bearing surfaces retrieved from the observed time-dependent broadening and shift of a selected spectral band, respectively. The main result of the in situ investigation was that the monolithic sliding couple showed both significantly lower temperature and lower magnitude of compressive stress at the contact point as compared to the composite one, although the composite couple wore at a significantly lower specific wear rate than the monolithic one.",

        "abstract": "A technique is presented for wide exposure of the acetabulum for revision total hip arthroplasty surgery in the presence of a solidly fixed, modular, or monoblock femoral component without the need for trochanteric osteotomy. The technique involves release of the proximal portion of the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis muscles and the iliopsoas tendon form the femur and placement of the femoral head/neck posterior to the acetabulum. The exposure afforded by this release usually precludes the need for trochanteric osteotomy and/or removal of a well-fixed femoral component in revision surgery that is being done for isolated loosening of acetabular components, thereby decreasing operative time, morbidity, and the risks of complication of trochanteric osteotomy.",

        "abstract": "An analysis of some 100 published and communicated findings on running-in volumetric wear and steady state wear rates from simulator tests carried out in eight laboratories in three countries has been undertaken. Powerful indications have emerged of the dominant role of mixed lubrication in current metal-on-metal hip replacements, with elastohydrodynamic film thickness controlling wear. The background to the calculation of film thickness in the elastic-isoviscous mode of lubrication has been outlined and graphs of representative film thickness and lambda ratio have been presented. For minimum wear and wear rate the diameter of the femoral component should be as large as possible, while the clearance should be as small as is practicable. The findings are valid for both monolithic and surface replacement implants. A tentative proposal is made for the prediction of lifetime wear in metal-on-metal total hip replacements.",

However, these new interfaces can lead to complications that were not observed with monolithic components. These problems have been noted with modular femoral and acetabular components and have been associated with the generation of particulate debris. This article reviews the authors' clinical observations and histologic, biomechanic, and spectophotometric evaluations of modular total hip arthroplasties. New data comparing both synovial fluid metal levels in well-fixed and loose monolithic and modular prosthetic hip implants are presented. In modular total hip components, synovial fluid cobalt levels correlated positively with patient weight and length of implantation. The generation of particulate debris in modular total hip components may induce periprosthetic osteolysis. Taper locks for femoral components and locking mechanisms for the polyethylene liner and metallic cup must be designed to avoid the production of particulate debris.",
