        "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of Upadacitinib in treating moderate-to-severe alopecia areata (AA). A comprehensive search of multiple databases identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through December 2023. Primary outcomes included SALT score improvements and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included quality of life measures and long-term safety data. The analysis included 8 RCTs with 2,456 participants. Pooled analysis showed significant improvement in SALT scores with Upadacitinib compared to placebo (weighted mean difference: 52.3%, 95% CI: 45.8-58.8). The most common adverse events were upper respiratory infections and acne. The findings support Upadacitinib's efficacy in treating AA with a manageable safety profile.",
