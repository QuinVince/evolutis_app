Failure was characterized by rapidly progressive acetabular or femoral osteolytic lesions that resulted in extensive bone loss, often in patients who had no symptoms. In addition to the debris that typically is generated by a metal on plastic bearing couple, an abundance of polyethylene particles of submicron size were produced at the cup-bone interface. Tissues retrieved from areas of osteolysis revealed the presence of intracellular submicron polyethylene particles in macrophages. It is recommended that patients with no symptoms who have RM noncemented, uncoated acetabular cups be followed up yearly and undergo early revision surgery when faced with osteolysis to prevent extensive bone loss.","publication date":"1999-05-01T00:00:00.000","Justification":"Criteria 1: The study includes adults with hip conditions but does not specify revision surgery. | \"Uncertain\"","Answer 1":"Uncertain","Justification.1":"Criteria 2: The article describes primary total hip replacements using cemented stems, not cementless revision stems. | \"No\"","Answer 2":"No","Justification.2":"Criteria 3: The article reports failure rates and radiological evaluations. | \"Yes\"","Answer 3":"Yes","Justification.3":"Criteria 4: The article reports clinical data on humans. | \"Yes\"","Answer 4":"Yes","Justification.4":"Criteria 5: The article mentions monoblock stems. | \"Yes\"","Answer 5":"Yes","Justification.5":"Criteria 6: The article is in English. | \"Yes\"","Answer 6":"Yes"},{"pubmed_id":15057088,"title":"Proximal ingrowth components.","abstract":"The advantage of using a proximal ingrowth hip revision component is restoring physiologic load to the revision femur.

In response, a proprietary process of taper roller-hardening that increases taper strength by a factor of 3.5 was introduced in 1999. The authors reviewed a consecutive series of patients by a single surgeon who underwent cementless revision or difficult primary THA with a taper roller-hardened modular calcar replacement prosthesis, and have the potential for a minimum of two-year follow up. In 116 patients, 123 hips were involved. Two surgeries were primary, 101 were revision\/conversion, 18 were for reimplantation after treatment of infection, and two were intramedullary total femur constructs, one of which was a reimplantation after sepsis. The patients' ages at surgery averaged 71 years, and BMIs averaged 28.12 kg\/m2. Nine of the patients, all with single hip involvement, were lost to contact. Twenty-one patients, three of whom had bilateral hip involvement, expired during the follow-up period with implant outcome known. Follow up in the patients who survived averaged 44 (range: 18-78) months. Six femoral components have been revised: two (1.6%) due to recurrent sepsis, three (2.4%) due to sepsis, one (0.8%) from periprosthetic fracture, and none from septic loosening or component breakage. Survivorship with aseptic loosening as the end-point was 100%. In this series, roller-hardening appears to improve the durability of the tapered junction. No roller-hardened modular calcar devices have failed due to component breakage. However, their use is not recommended in the totally deficient proximal femur, as fatigue breaks of distally fixed monoblock extensively coated stems have been reported. Caution is advised when potting or anchoring any stem in the femoral diaphysis without reconstituting proximal bone stock and support.","publication date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000","Justification":"Criteria 1: The study includes adults undergoing revision hip surgery. | \"Yes\"","Answer 1":"Yes","Justification.1":"Criteria 2: The article describes a cementless revision but focuses on modular stems, not monoblock ones. | \"No\"","Answer 2":"No","Justification.2":"Criteria 3: The article evaluates survival rates and reports complications and revision rates. | \"Yes\"","Answer 3":"Yes","Justification.3":"Criteria 4: The article reports human clinical data and excludes cadaver or mechanical studies. | \"Yes\"","Answer 4":"Yes","Justification.4":"Criteria 5: The article focuses on modular stems and does not compare them to monoblock stems. | \"No\"","Answer 5":"No","Justification.5":"Criteria 6: The article is in English. | \"Yes\"","Answer 6":"Yes"},{"pubmed_id":19301791,"title":"Protrusio of a ceramic femoral head through the acetabular metallic shell, extensive metallosis and 'bubble sign'.","abstract":"A 24-year-old patient with a history of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis underwent a primary cementless left total hip arthroplasty (THA).

The mean age at the time of implantation was 43 years (26 to 60) and at the latest follow-up it was 72 years. In all patients the cemented UHMW PE acetabular component (RCH 1000) was used together with AKV Ultra 2 Poldi steel femoral stems (1st, 2nd and 3rd generations). The stem was a monoblock with a 32-mm head. The evaluation of the results was based on the Harris hip score and X ray with an A-P view of the pelvis and the affected hip. Statistical analysis was made using the life-table method. At the latest follow up the mean Harris score was 69.7 points (40 to 88). There were 69 hips with an original Poldi-\u010cech femoral component still in situ, 64 of them were stable and five with radiological evidence of aseptic loosening. Five patients had undergone Girdlestone resection arthroplasty for septic loosening. Thirteen patients (16 hips) had femoral stem revision. The cumulative proportion of clinical survivorship of the Poldi-\u010cech femoral stem, with revision for any reason as the endpoint, .was 0.93 at 6 years, 0.84 at 12 years, and 0.77 at 18, 24 and 30 years after the index surgery. Radiographic findings revealed 64 hips with stable stems, five hips with ;aseptic loosening (probable, 0 possible, 2, definite, 3). Six- teen hips were after revision surgery for aseptic loosening of the stem and five hips were after Girdlestone resection arthroplasty for septic failure.

The Poldi-\u010cech stem with its anatomical shape and a highly polished surface meets the principles of successful composite beam stems.

The aim of this study was to provide evidence that the recementing of a femoral stem into the original cement mantle can be included in routine surgical procedures. A group of 104 patients with femoral stem revision, followed-up for an average of 50.2 months, were retrospectively reviewed. The outcome evaluation was focused, in the first place, on survivorship of the femoral component, acetabular migration, and dislocation and infection after revision arthroplasty. Hip function evaluation was based on the Harris hip scores before surgery and at the latest follow-up. On radiographs Gruen zones were assessed pre-operatively and at the latest follow-up. The results were statistically evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Statistica 8.0). Of the 104 patients, only three (2.9 %) had stem re-revision due to its loosening. Further 16 patients underwent revision for other post-operative complications. The success rate of reimplantation in our group including all post-operative complications was 81.7 %. The average Harris scores were 56 before surgery and 87 at the latest follow-up. Radiolucent lines in Gruen zones were on average 0.45 mm in width before revision and 0.15 mm at the latest follow-up. Fourteen patients had second revision within 20 months of the first and only five were revised after a long period. The cement-within-cement exchange of a femoral component is a relatively frequent orthopaedic procedure. Despite this frequency, however, there have not been enough literature reports based on large patient groups to give support to its routine use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate on a large patient group that recementing a femoral stem into the original intact cement mantle can be considered an established operative technique. Our results suggest that the list of indications for this technique, as described by Lieberman and Nelson, can be extended by the following: broken stem with an intact distal cement mantle, replacement of a monoblock femoral component due to severe head damage, loosening of the femoral component without impairment of the distal cement mantle, conversion of a cervico-capital to a total hip replacement and the need of removing all bone cement. No risk is associated with reimplantation of the original component if there is no need for a different implant to correct angle or length stability. A new implant is always used when any part of the femoral component has been damaged mechanically. If only the proximal stem requires recementing, the use of the original component is preferred because of absolute cement\/stem cohesion. The number of our patients in which the technique failed was generally in agreement with the results of other authors. Utilisation of the original cement mantle of a femoral component is one of the options at revision arthroplasty. It requires rational considerations based on the type of surgery, state of the cement mantle, and type of material used for the femoral stem. The method is indicated preferably in the hips with an intact cement mantle treated for loosening of the acetabular component, recurrent dislocation or unequal leg-length in monoblock femoral components. In such situations the removal of well-fixed cement would also involve a considerable loss of bone tissue. The follow-up outcomes showed that the involvement of the cement-within-cement technique in routinely used surgical procedures is fully justified.","publication date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000","Justification":"Criteria 1: The study includes adults undergoing revision hip surgery. | \"Yes\"","Answer 1":"Yes","Justification.1":"Criteria 2: The article describes a cemented femoral component, not a cementless revision stem. | \"No\"","Answer 2":"No","Justification.2":"Criteria 3: The article evaluates survivorship, Harris hip scores, and radiological evaluations. | \"Yes\"","Answer 3":"Yes","Justification.3":"Criteria 4: The article reports human clinical data and excludes cadaver or mechanical studies. | \"Yes\"","Answer 4":"Yes","Justification.4":"Criteria 5: The article mentions monoblock femoral components. | \"Yes\"","Answer 5":"Yes","Justification.5":"Criteria 6: The article is in English. | \"Yes\"","Answer 6":"Yes"},{"pubmed_id":22245150,"title":"A well-fixed femoral stem facing a failed acetabular component: to exchange or not?

Sparing the femoral component reduces morbidity, but can make acetabular replacement technically more difficult. Moreover, the outcome of the retained femoral component is also a question, especially with older implants. Isolated acetabular component RTHA results in lower surgical morbidity, and does not increase the risk of later femoral complications. Eighty-nine patients, mean age 68, underwent surgery (anterior approach on traction table) for isolated acetabular component revision between 1994 and 2005. The femoral component had been implanted a mean 10.5 years before revision. Fifteen patients died, mean age 84.5. Eleven patients, mean age 81.3, were lost to follow-up and four underwent revision due to a subsequent infection (range 14 months - 11 years). Fifty-nine patients were evaluated after a mean 8.6 years (range 4 - 15 years).

Five patients (5.6%) underwent surgery again due to postoperative dislocation. Six patients underwent surgery for recurrent acetabular loosening due to allograft resorption. The size of the bone defects did not increase the risk of these failures (P>0.6). Fractures occurred in two femoral components 6 and 9 years after revision. Polyethylene wear occurred in three patients requiring two repeat revisions at 6 and 7 years. In both cases the femoral component included a titanium head, which caused the wear. Implant survival at 8.6 years was 85.16 \u00b1 0.117% all causes of revision combined, 88.47 \u00b1 0.113% if infectious causes were excluded and 93.6 \u00b1 0.07% if only cases of acetabular component failure were taken into account. Intermediate term outcomes are satisfactory if stable femoral components are retained. Nevertheless, this procedure should be performed in situations of correctly oriented modular components. In single piece (monoblock) femoral implants, or in implants with a history of failure, this technique should be restricted to elderly and\/or fragile patients.

The modern monoblock prosthesis, introduced by Dr. Sir John Charnley, has seen many modifications since its inception in the 1970s and continues to be the most commonly used prosthesis style for primary and revision THA. Proximal modular sleeve technology was introduced in 1967 by Konstantin Sivash, modifying his original 1956 Sivash Stem design. The design is now known as the S-ROM, and although design modifications continue to date, the fundamental structure of the S-ROM remains essentially unchanged. Several other proximal modular prostheses are now currently available for use in THA. Although this similarity in design enables considerable surgical flexibility, it also links their potential for catastrophic failure. This aim of this article was to present a brief history of proximal modularity in THA and to add to the small body of literature regarding catastrophic failure in modular hip implants, including its proposed etiologies including micromotion, fretting and corrosion.","publication date":"2013-07-01T00:00:00.000","Justification":"Criteria 1: The study does not specify the population as adults needing revision hip surgery. | \"Uncertain\"","Answer 1":"Uncertain","Justification.1":"Criteria 2: The article discusses modular stems and does not mention cementless revision stems for revision or complex primary THA. | \"No\"","Answer 2":"No","Justification.2":"Criteria 3: The article does not evaluate clinical scores, survival rates, comparisons with other devices, radiological evaluations, or complications\/revision rates. | \"No\"","Answer 3":"No","Justification.3":"Criteria 4: The article focuses on the history and failure of modular hip implants, not clinical data on humans. | \"No\"","Answer 4":"No","Justification.4":"Criteria 5: The article focuses on modular stems without mentioning monoblock stems. | \"No\"","Answer 5":"No","Justification.5":"Criteria 6: The article is in English. | \"Yes\"","Answer 6":"Yes"},{"pubmed_id":24182871,"title":"The potential application of a Cobalt Chrome Molybdenum femoral stem with functionally graded orthotropic structures manufactured using Laser Melting technologies.","abstract":"The cementless fixation of porous coated femoral stems is a common technique employed for Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). With the rate of revision surgery appearing to rise and younger more active patients requiring primary surgery it can be thought that alternative methods for increasing implant longevity need to be considered. The stress shielding of periprosthetic bone still remains a contributing factor to implant loosening, caused through a mismatch in stiffness between the implant and the bone. However, the ability to achieve stiffness matching characteristics is being realised through the use of Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) technologies and Functionally Graded Materials (FGM). This paper proposes an alternative design methodology for a monoblock Cobalt Chrome Molybdenum (CoCrMo) femoral stem. It hypothesises that a femoral stem suitable for cementless fixation can be manufactured using Laser Melting (LM) technology offering orthotropic functionally graded porous structures with similar mechanical properties to human bone. The structure and mechanical properties of the natural femur have been used as a basis for the design criteria which hypothesises that through a combination of numerical analysis and physical testing, an optimal design can be proposed to provide a lightweight, customised femoral stem that can reduce the risk of implant loosening through stress shielding whilst maintaining bone-implant interface stability.","publication date":"2013-12-01T00:00:00.000","Justification":"Criteria 1: The study does not specify the population studied as adults with hip conditions or needing revision hip surgery. | \"Uncertain\"","Answer 1":"Uncertain","Justification.1":"Criteria 2: The article discusses a cementless femoral stem but does not specify its use in revision THA or complex primary THA. | \"Uncertain\"","Answer 2":"Uncertain","Justification.2":"Criteria 3: The article does not mention evaluating clinical scores, survival rates, comparisons with other devices, radiological evaluations, or complications\/revision rates. | \"No\"","Answer 3":"No","Justification.3":"Criteria 4: The article focuses on design methodology and mechanical properties, not clinical data on humans. | \"No\"","Answer 4":"No","Justification.4":"Criteria 5: The article discusses a monoblock Cobalt Chrome Molybdenum femoral stem. | \"Yes\"","Answer 5":"Yes","Justification.5":"Criteria 6: The article is in English. | \"Yes\"","Answer 6":"Yes"},{"pubmed_id":24613500,"title":"A numerical investigation into the influence of the properties of cobalt chrome cellular structures on the load transfer to the periprosthetic femur following total hip arthroplasty.","abstract":"Stress shielding of the periprosthetic femur following total hip arthroplasty is a problem that can promote the premature loosening of femoral stems. In order to reduce the need for revision surgery it is thought that more flexible implant designs need to be considered. In this work, the mechanical properties of laser melted square pore cobalt chrome molybdenum cellular structures have been incorporated into the design of a traditional monoblock femoral stem. The influence of incorporating the properties of cellular structures on the load transfer to the periprosthetic femur was investigated using a three dimensional finite element model. Eleven different stiffness configurations were investigated by using fully porous and functionally graded approaches. This investigation confirms that the periprosthetic stress values depend on the stiffness configuration of the stem. The numerical results showed that stress shielding is reduced in the periprosthetic Gruen zones when the mechanical properties of cobalt chrome molybdenum cellular structures are used. This work identifies that monoblock femoral stems manufactured using a laser melting process, which are designed for reduced stiffness, have the potential to contribute towards reducing stress shielding.","publication date":"2014-04-01T00:00:00.000","Justification":"Criteria 1: The study does not specify the population studied, whether adults or needing revision hip surgery. | \"Uncertain\"","Answer 1":"Uncertain","Justification.1":"Criteria 2: The article does not mention cementless revision stems or complex primary total hip arthroplasty. | \"No\"","Answer 2":"No","Justification.2":"Criteria 3: The study does not evaluate clinical scores, survival rates, comparisons with other devices, radiological evaluations, or complications\/revision rates. | \"No\"","Answer 3":"No","Justification.3":"Criteria 4: The article uses finite element studies, not clinical human data. | \"No\"","Answer 4":"No","Justification.4":"Criteria 5: The article mentions monoblock stems but does not compare them to another type. | \"Uncertain\"","Answer 5":"Uncertain","Justification.5":"Criteria 6: The article is in English. | \"Yes\"","Answer 6":"Yes"},{"pubmed_id":25070918,"title":"How have alternative bearings and modularity affected revision rates in total hip arthroplasty?","abstract":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) continues to be one of the most successful surgical procedures in the medical field. However, over the last two decades, the use of modularity and alternative bearings in THA has become routine. Given the known problems associated with hard-on-hard bearing couples, including taper failures with more modular stem designs, local and systemic effects from metal-on-metal bearings, and fractures with ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, it is not known whether in aggregate the survivorship of these implants is better or worse than the metal-on-polyethylene bearings that they sought to replace. Have alternative bearings (metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-ceramic) and implant modularity decreased revision rates of primary THAs? In this systematic review of MEDLINE and EMBASE, we used several Boolean search strings for each topic and surveyed national registry data from English-speaking countries. Clinical research (Level IV or higher) with \u2265\u00a05\u00a0years of followup was included; retrieval studies and case reports were excluded. We included registry data at \u2265\u00a07\u00a0years followup. A total of 32 studies (and five registry reports) on metal-on-metal, 19 studies (and five registry reports) on ceramic-on-ceramic, and 20 studies (and one registry report) on modular stem designs met inclusion criteria and were evaluated in detail. Insufficient data were available on metal-on-ceramic and ceramic-on-metal implants, and monoblock acetabular designs were evaluated in another recent systematic review so these were not evaluated here. There was no evidence in the literature that alternative bearings (either metal-on-metal or ceramic-on-ceramic) in THA have decreased revision rates. Registry data, however, showed that large head metal-on-metal implants have lower 7- to 10-year survivorship than do standard bearings. In THA, modular exchangeable femoral neck implants had a lower 10-year survival rate in both literature reviews and in registry data compared with combined registry primary THA implant survivorship. Despite improvements in implant technology, there is no evidence that alternative bearings or modularity have resulted in decreased THA revision rates after 5\u00a0years. In fact, both large head metal-on-metal THA and added modularity may well lower survivorship and should only be used in select cases in which the mission cannot be achieved without it. Based on this experience, followup and\/or postmarket surveillance studies should have a duration of at least 5\u00a0years before introducing new alternative bearings or modularity on a widespread scale.","publication date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00.000","Justification":"Criteria 1: The study does not specify the population age or the need for revision hip surgery. | \"Uncertain\"","Answer 1":"Uncertain","Justification.1":"Criteria 2: The article does not mention the use of cementless revision stems or complex primary total hip arthroplasty. | \"No\"","Answer 2":"No","Justification.2":"Criteria 3: The article evaluates revision rates and survivorship. | \"Yes\"","Answer 3":"Yes","Justification.3":"Criteria 4: The article includes clinical data on humans and excludes case reports. | \"Yes\"","Answer 4":"Yes","Justification.4":"Criteria 5: The article focuses on modular stems and does not mention monoblock stems. | \"No\"","Answer 5":"No","Justification.5":"Criteria 6: The article is in English. | \"Yes\"","Answer 6":"Yes"}]
